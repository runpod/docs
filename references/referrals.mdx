Runpod offers three programs that help you earn additional revenue while helping us grow our community. Whether you're referring new users, creating popular templates, or driving significant traffic, there's a program that fits your contribution style.

## Runpod referral program

Earn Runpod Credits when users you refer spend on Serverless or Pods. The referral program rewards both you and the person you refer, creating a win-win situation for everyone involved.

### How rewards work

When someone signs up using your referral link and starts spending on Runpod, you earn a percentage of their spend as Runpod Credits:

- **5% commission** on all Serverless spend for the first 6 months.
- **3% commission** on all Pod spend for the first 6 months.
- **Bonus credits** for both you and your referral after they load \$10 on their account (you'll both receive a random value between \$5 and \$500).

If you referred users before June 16, 2025, you're part of our beta program group. This means you'll continue earning commissions on their spend indefinitely, not just for 6 months.

## Runpod affiliate program

The affiliate program is designed for high-performing referrers who want to earn cash instead of credits. Through our partnership with Partnerstack, eligible referrers can earn 10% cash commissions on all referral spend.

### Eligibility and rewards

To qualify for the affiliate program, you need to have referred at least 25 paying users through the standard referral program. Once eligible, you can choose to upgrade to the affiliate program, which offers:

- **10% cash commission** on all referral spend for the first 6 months.
- Professional tracking and reporting through Partnerstack.
- Direct cash payments instead of Runpod Credits.

Once you opt into the affiliate program, this decision is permanent. Choose carefully based on whether you prefer cash payments or Runpod Credits.

For beta program participants (users referred before June 26, 2025), a special arrangement applies. These users will be eligible for Partnerstack commissions during their first 6 months. After that period, they'll return to the standard referral program but continue generating commissions indefinitely.

## Runpod creator program

The creator program rewards users who build popular [Pod templates](/pods/templates/overview) that others use on the platform. Every time someone runs a Pod using your template, you earn a percentage of their spend.

### How it works

Template creators earn **1% in Runpod Credits** for every dollar spent using their templates. This creates a passive income stream that grows with your template's popularity.

For example, if 20 users run Pods using your template at \$0.54/hour for a full week, you'll earn \$18.14 in credits. The more useful and popular your template, the more you can earn.

### Getting started with templates

To participate in the creator program, your template must accumulate at least 1 day of total runtime across all users. Focus on creating templates that solve real problems or make it easier for users to get started with specific workloads.

## How to participate

Getting started with any of these programs is straightforward:

1. Navigate to your [referral dashboard](https://www.console.runpod.io/user/referrals) in the Runpod console.
2. Find your unique referral link (it will look something like `https://runpod.io?ref=5t99c9je`).
3. Share this link with potential users through your preferred channels.

For the creator program, simply publish templates through your Runpod account and promote them to potential users.

## Important details

Understanding how these programs work will help you maximize your earnings:

1. **Referral commissions are based on actual usage, not purchases.** If someone you refer buys \$1,000 in credits, you won't earn commission until they actually use those credits on Pods or Serverless workloads.
2. **New accounts only.** Referral links only work for brand new Runpod users. If someone already has an account, referring them won't generate commissions.
3. **Bonus credit distribution is weighted.** Credits for referrals are awarded through a weighted random system. Most users will receive a bonus of \$5, with about 96% of users receiving \$10 or less.

## Support

Have questions about maximizing your earnings or need help with any of these programs? [Contact our support team](https://contact.runpod.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance.

Remember, if you're transitioning to the affiliate program, you'll keep all earnings accumulated through the referral program before making the switch.
