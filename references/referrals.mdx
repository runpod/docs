RunPod offers two referral programs and a template program that allow users to earn additional revenue in the form of RunPod Credits. This document provides an overview of these programs and instructions on how to participate.

## Referral Programs

### 3. Template Referral Program (BETA)

The Template Program allows users to earn a percentage of the money spent by users who use their Pod Template.

## How to Participate

1. Access your [referral dashboard](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/referrals).
2. Locate your unique referral link. For example, `https://runpod.io?ref=5t99c9je`.
3. Share your referral link with potential users.

#### Important Notes

1. Commissions are calculated as a percentage of credits used, not credits purchased. So if your friend purchases \$1000 in credits, you won't receive a commission until they use them.
2. Referrals are only valid when the referred user creates a new account using your referral link. If your referral already had a RunPod account, you won't receive a commission for referring them.

## Support

If you have any questions or need assistance with the referral or template programs, [please contact](https://contact.runpod.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) the RunPod support team.

RunPod allows referrers to keep the earnings made before activation once they meet the eligibility criteria and are accepted into the program.
