This page covers how Runpod secures your data, complies with privacy regulations, and where to find legal documentation.

## Data security

### Multi-tenant isolation

Your Pod runs in a multi-tenant environment with containerized isolation that prevents other users from accessing your data. Each Pod operates in its own container with strict separation from other workloads.

For sensitive workloads requiring enhanced security, Secure Cloud operates in T3/T4 data centers with enterprise-grade security, high reliability, redundancy, and fast response times.

### Host access policies

Runpod's Terms of Service prohibit hosts from inspecting your Pod data or analyzing your usage patterns. Any violation results in immediate removal from the platform.

For workloads requiring the highest level of security, Secure Cloud provides vetted infrastructure partners who meet enterprise security standards including SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS certifications.

## GDPR compliance

Runpod is fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for data processed in European data center regions. The platform implements comprehensive policies, procedures, and technical measures to meet GDPR requirements.

### Compliance measures

For servers hosted in GDPR-compliant regions like the European Union, Runpod maintains clear procedures for the collection, storage, processing, and deletion of personal data. These procedures ensure transparency and accountability in data processing activities.

Technical and organizational measures protect personal data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Runpod obtains and records consent from individuals for processing their personal data, and provides mechanisms for individuals to withdraw consent.

The platform facilitates data subject rights under GDPR, including the right to access, rectify, erase, or restrict the processing of personal data. Data subject requests are handled promptly and efficiently.

For lawful transfer of personal data outside the EU, Runpod uses appropriate mechanisms such as adequacy decisions, standard contractual clauses, or binding corporate rules. Regular monitoring and internal audits ensure ongoing GDPR compliance, including data protection impact assessments as needed.
