---

If you see a blank or white page when opening JupyterLab on your Pod, this can happen for several reasons. The JupyterLab link may show as ready in the console but still open to a non-responsive page because the readiness check is only a basic HTTP ping, not a true health signal.

## Understanding Pod readiness

The Runpod console periodically pings a URL inside your Pod to check its status. When the console displays a "Ready" status, it only means the Pod is responding to HTTP requests—not that JupyterLab is fully interactive.

Even when the UI shows your Pod as ready, JupyterLab may need additional time to fully load and become usable. This is normal and expected behavior.

## Common causes

A blank JupyterLab page can happen for several reasons, and sometimes multiple issues occur at once:

**Pod still starting up**: You might see a white or blank screen for some time after starting your Pod. This happens because Pod resources or services aren't fully initialized yet, even though the HTTP endpoint is responding.

**Jupyter service still loading**: If you see an intermittent white screen or partial load right after starting your Pod, the Jupyter process may still be spinning up or performing initial setup work.

**Browser cache issues**: If you keep seeing the same blank screen after closing and reopening the JupyterLab link, your browser (or an intermediate layer) might be serving a cached broken response.

**Network problems**: If JupyterLab fails to load or stalls while other sites are also slow, you may have local network or connectivity issues between your machine and the Pod.

**Misconfigured Pod or template**: If JupyterLab never loads despite multiple restarts and long waits, the image or template might not be starting Jupyter on the expected port or path.

## Troubleshooting steps

Follow the steps below based on what you're currently seeing.

### Status shows "Initializing"

Wait at least 30–60 seconds after Pod start before opening JupyterLab. The Pod needs time to fully initialize all services.

### Status shows "Ready" but page is blank

1. Wait on the blank screen for at least 60 seconds to allow JupyterLab to finish starting.

2. Try a hard refresh:
   - Windows/Linux: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

3. Open the JupyterLab link in a private or incognito window to rule out browser caching.

4. If still blank, check your Pod logs in the Runpod console for JupyterLab-related errors or confirmation that Jupyter has started. Look for messages indicating that Jupyter is running on port 8888 (or your configured port).

5. If you see errors or Jupyter never appears to start, restart the Pod once and repeat the steps above.

### Repeated restarts

If you're restarting more than once for the same Pod and JupyterLab never loads, treat this as a configuration or template issue rather than a transient startup delay.

Verify the following:

- You are using a template known to support JupyterLab on the documented port (typically 8888).
- Any required environment variables or startup commands for Jupyter are correctly set in your template configuration.

If still stuck, share your Pod logs and template configuration with support or in the Runpod Discord rather than repeatedly restarting.

### Logs show Jupyter started but page is still blank

1. Confirm that your browser is not blocking mixed content, popups, or scripts for the Runpod domain.

2. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to rule out browser-specific issues.

3. Try a different network connection (use a phone hotspot) to rule out local network filtering or firewall issues.

4. If the issue persists across browsers and networks, include log snippets and Pod details in a support request or Discord post.

## When to get help

Use this troubleshooting guide when:

- JupyterLab is slow to start after Pod deployment.
- You get an occasional white screen right after Pod startup.

Contact support or post in the Runpod Discord when:

- JupyterLab has never successfully loaded for a given template.
- You have repeated failures after following the wait–refresh–restart flow once.
- Pod logs show recurring errors you don't understand.

<Note>

Some delay and occasional white screens are expected because JupyterLab runs inside a full Pod and startup times vary based on the image, hardware, and current load. The UI status indicator is a best-effort signal, not a guarantee that JupyterLab is fully interactive.
