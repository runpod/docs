Payment card declines can occur when adding funds to your Runpod account. Credit card processors apply stringent fraud detection standards, particularly for international transactions. This document provides guidance to help you troubleshoot payment issues.

**Keep your balance topped up**

To prevent service interruptions, refresh your balance at least a few days before it runs out. This gives you time to address any payment delays.

You can enable automatic balance refresh from the [Billing page](https://www.console.runpod.io/user/billing):

## Contact your card issuer

If your card is declined, contact your issuing bank to determine the reason. Due to privacy standards, payment processors only indicate that a transaction was not processed without providing specific details. Your bank can tell you why the payment was declined.

Card declines often occur for routine reasons, such as anti-fraud protection. Your bank can resolve blocks they have placed on your card.

<Warning>

Contact your bank about the initial decline before trying a different card. The payment processor may block all funding attempts from your account if it detects multiple card declines, even if those cards would otherwise work. These account blocks typically clear after 24 hours.

</Warning>

## Other reasons for card blocks

The payment processor may block cards based on user risk profiles. Using several different cards within a short period or having disputed transactions in the past may trigger card declines.
