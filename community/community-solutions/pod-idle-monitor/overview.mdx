RunPod Monitor helps you save money by automatically stopping idle pods. It provides both organization-level monitoring with a web dashboard and self-contained monitoring that runs directly within your pod.

## Quick deployment

Deploy the organization monitor on RunPod: [Deploy template](https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=xe00ihiurd&ref=p1oqnqy1)

For the cheapest option, run on a CPU pod. The monitor automatically excludes itself from monitoring.

## Self-contained monitoring

For individual pod monitoring without external dependencies, use the self-contained version that runs directly in your pod.

### One-line installation

Inside your RunPod pod terminal:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y tmux curl && \
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinwlin/Runpod-Idle-Pod-Monitor/refs/heads/main/self-contained/quick_install.sh -o /tmp/quick_install.sh && \
chmod +x /tmp/quick_install.sh && /tmp/quick_install.sh
```

This installs a monitor that:
- Runs in tmux and survives SSH disconnections
- Monitors CPU, GPU, and memory usage
- Automatically stops your pod when idle
- Provides real-time resource monitoring

### Managing the monitor

- **Detach from monitor:** `Ctrl+B` then `D`
- **Reattach to monitor:** `tmux attach -t monitor`
- **Check status:** `cat /tmp/monitor_counter.json`

## Organization-level monitoring

The web dashboard provides centralized monitoring for all your pods with a clean interface for managing auto-stop rules.

### Features

- **Real-time monitoring** - View all pod statuses at a glance
- **Auto-stop configuration** - Set CPU/GPU/memory thresholds
- **Historical metrics** - Track usage patterns over time
- **Exclude lists** - Protect critical workloads
- **Network storage support** - Handles paused pods with storage

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  docker.io/justinrunpod/runpodidlemonitor:2.3
```

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`

### Configuration

Configure auto-stop settings through the web UI:

- **CPU threshold** - Stop when CPU usage ≤5% (adjustable)
- **GPU threshold** - Stop when GPU usage ≤5% (adjustable)  
- **Memory threshold** - Stop when memory usage is low
- **Duration** - How long conditions must persist (e.g., 45 minutes)
- **No-change detection** - Stop completely idle pods

## Development setup

To run locally for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justinwlin/Runpod-Idle-Pod-Monitor.git
cd Runpod-Idle-Pod-Monitor
echo "RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
pip install uv
uv pip install .
python server.py
```

## Cost optimization tips

1. **Start with monitoring only** - Test thresholds before enabling auto-stop
2. **Use exclude lists** - Protect production workloads
3. **Set appropriate durations** - Avoid stopping pods too quickly
4. **Monitor network storage pods** - They can be paused instead of stopped
5. **Review historical data** - Optimize thresholds based on actual usage patterns
