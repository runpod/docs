Starting in September 2025, every repository [published to the Runpod Hub](/hub/publishing-guide) automatically generates revenue for its maintainers. When users deploy your repositories from the Hub to run on Runpod infrastructure, you earn up to 7% of the compute revenue they generate, paid directly to your Runpod credit balance.

### How it works

Revenue share is calculated based on the total compute hours generated by users running your repositories each month. The percentage you earn depends on your monthly usage tier, with higher tiers offering better revenue rates.

1. Users deploy your repos: When users find and deploy your repositories from the Hub, they generate compute hours on Runpod infrastructure.
2. Usage is tracked: The platform tracks all compute hours generated by deployments of your repositories.
3. Monthly calculations: At the end of each month, your total compute hours are calculated and assigned to a revenue tier.
4. Credits deposited: Your revenue share is automatically deposited into your Runpod account balance.

### Revenue tiers

Revenue tiers reset monthly based on the total compute hours generated by all your published repositories:

* 10,000+ hours: 7% revenue share
* 5,000-9,999 hours: 5% revenue share
* 1,000-4,999 hours: 3% revenue share
* 100-999 hours: 1% revenue share
* Below 100 hours: 0% revenue share

For example, if users generate 2,500 compute hours using your repositories in a month, you would earn $75 in Runpod credits from those hours (3% of the total compute revenue).

### Requirements

To participate in the revenue sharing program, you must:

1. Link your GitHub profile: Connect your Runpod account to your GitHub profile for verified maintainer status. This ensures you receive credits for repositories you maintain.
2. Have published repositories: Your repositories must be successfully published and approved in the Hub.
3. Maintain active repositories: Keep your repositories up to date with working releases.

### Payment timing

Credits are deposited into your Runpod account balance during the first week of each month. Revenue is calculated based on the previous month's activity.
