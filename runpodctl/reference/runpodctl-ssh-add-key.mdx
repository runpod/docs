Add an SSH public key to your Runpod account for secure Pod access. If no key is provided, a new key pair will be generated automatically.

```sh
runpodctl ssh add-key [flags]
```

## Example

Add an SSH key from a file:

```sh
runpodctl ssh add-key --key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

## Flags

The following flags are available for the `ssh add-key` command:

---

`--key <value>` • `string`

The SSH public key content to add to your account. This should be the full public key string.

---

`--key-file <value>` • `string`

The path to a file containing the SSH public key to add. This is typically a `.pub` file from your SSH key pair.
