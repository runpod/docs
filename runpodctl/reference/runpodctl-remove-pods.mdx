Terminate multiple Pods that share the same name. This is useful for cleaning up groups of Pods created with the `create pods` command.

```sh
runpodctl remove pods <name> [flags]
```

## Example

Terminate all Pods named "training-worker":

```sh
runpodctl remove pods training-worker
```

## Arguments

`<name>` • `string` • required

The name of the Pods to terminate. All Pods with this exact name will be removed.

## Flags

The following flags are available for the `remove pods` command:

---

`--podCount <number>` • `integer` • optional

The number of Pods with the specified name to terminate. This limits the removal to a specific count rather than removing all matching Pods.
