A RunPod project is a structured environment that allows you to develop, test, and deploy applications and endpoints on RunPod's cloud infrastructure.

It encapsulates all the necessary files, dependencies, and configurations needed to run a development session on a Pod, making it easier to manage and maintain your codebase.

## Why use RunPod projects?

### Streamlined development

RunPod projects streamline the development process by providing a consistent environment for your applications. This eliminates the need to manage complex setups and configurations on local machines, ensuring that your development environment mirrors the production environment.

### Scalability and flexibility

By leveraging RunPod's infrastructure, projects can scale effortlessly. You can run development sessions, test your code, and deploy endpoints without worrying about the underlying hardware. This scalability is particularly beneficial for resource-intensive applications such as machine learning models or data processing pipelines.

### Simplified deployment

Deploying a project on RunPod is straightforward. With a single command, you can turn your project into a Serverless endpoint, making it accessible over the internet. This reduces the time and effort required to go from development to production.

### Local vs. cloud environment

In traditional development workflows, you develop and test your code on your local machine before deploying it to a server or cloud environment. This can lead to discrepancies between your local environment and the production environment, causing unexpected issues.

With RunPod projects, your development and production environments are the same. You develop directly on Pods, ensuring consistency and eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem.

### Real-time updates

RunPod projects allow for real-time updates during development sessions. Changes made to your code locally are instantly propagated to the project environment on your Pod. This rapid feedback loop enhances productivity and allows for quicker iteration.

### Integrated dependency management

RunPod projects come with integrated dependency management. You can specify your project dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file, and RunPod ensures these dependencies are installed and up-to-date in your project environment. This simplifies dependency management and reduces potential conflicts.

### Serverless deployment

Deploying a project on RunPod transforms it into a Serverless endpoint. Unlike traditional deployments that require managing servers, load balancers, and other infrastructure components, RunPod abstracts away these complexities. You focus on your code, and RunPod handles the rest.

## Get started with projects

### Creating a Project

To create a new RunPod project, use the following command:

```sh
runpodctl project create
```

You will be prompted to select a starter project, which includes pre-configured settings for different types of environments. Customize your project as needed by adding dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running a development session

Start a development session with:

```sh
runpodctl project dev
```

This establishes an active connection between your local environment and the project environment on your Pod, allowing for real-time updates.

### Deploying a project

To deploy your project as a Serverless endpoint, run:

```sh
runpodctl project deploy
```

Your project is now accessible over the internet, and you can interact with it like any other Serverless endpoint.

### Building a project

If you prefer to build your project into a Docker image, use:

```sh
runpodctl project build
```

This generates a Dockerfile that you can use to build an image and deploy it to any API server.
