title: "Install runpodctl"

Runpod CLI is an [open-source](https://github.com/runpod/runpodctl) command-line interface (CLI) for managing Pods and Runpod projects.

When you create a Pod, it comes with `runpodctl` installed and configured with a Pod-scoped API key. You can also install and run `runpodctl` locally.

## Step 1: Install Runpod CLI locally

To install `runpodctl` on your local machine, run one of the commands below based on your operating system:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS">
```sh
brew install runpod/runpodctl/runpodctl
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Linux">
```sh
wget -qO- cli.runpod.net | sudo bash
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">
```sh
wget https://github.com/runpod/runpodctl/releases/download/v1.14.3/runpodctl-windows-amd64.exe -O runpodctl.exe
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

This installs Runpod CLI globally on your system, so you can run `runpodctl` commands from any directory.

## Step 2: Create an API key

Before you can use `runpodctl`, you must configure it with an [API key](/get-started/api-keys). Follow these steps to create a new API key:

1. In the web interface, go to the [Settings page](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/settings).
2. Expand the **API Keys** section and click the **Create API Key** button.
3. Give your key a name and set its permissions. If you want to [manage Pods](/runpodctl/manage-pods) locally, your key will need **READ/WRITE** permissions (or **ALL**).
4. Click **Create**, then click on your newly-generated key to copy it to your clipboard.

<Warning>
Runpod does not store your API key, so you may wish to save it elsewhere. Treat your API key like a password and don't share it with anyone.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Add your API key to runpodctl

Now that you've created an API key, run the following command to add it to `runpodctl`, replacing `[API_KEY]` with the key you just created:

```sh
runpodctl config --apiKey [API_KEY]
```

After running the command, you should see a confirmation message similar to this:

```text
saved apiKey into config file: /Users/runpod/.runpod/config.toml
```

## Step 4: Verify installation

Now that you've added your API key, verify that `runpodctl` installed successfully by running this command:

```sh
runpodctl version
```

You should see which version is installed.

```sh
runpodctl v1.14.4
```

## Next steps

Now that you have successfully installed and configured `runpodctl`, you can:

* [Manage your Pods](/runpodctl/manage-pods) from the command line.
* [Transfer files](/runpodctl/transfer-files) between your local machine and Pods.
* [Use projects](/runpodctl/projects/overview) to streamline endpoint development.
