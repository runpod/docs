title: "Network volumes"
description: "Persistent, portable storage for your AI workloads."
---

Network volumes offer persistent storage that exists independently of your compute resources. Your data is retained even when your Pods are terminated or your Serverless workers are scaled to zero. You can use them to share data and maintain datasets across multiple machines and [Runpod products](/overview).

Network volumes are backed by high-performance NVMe SSDs connected via high-speed networks. Transfer speeds typically range from 200-400 MB/s, with peak speeds up to 10 GB/s depending on location and network conditions.

## When to use network volumes

Consider using network volumes when you need:

- **Persistent data that outlives compute resources**: Your data remains accessible even after Pods are terminated or Serverless workers stop.
- **Shareable storage**: Share data across multiple Pods or Serverless endpoints by attaching the same network volume.
- **Portable storage**: Move your working environment and data between different compute resources.
- **Efficient data management**: Store frequently used models or large datasets to avoid re-downloading them for each new Pod or worker, saving time, bandwidth, and reducing cold start times.

## Pricing

Network volumes are billed at \$0.07 per GB per month for the first 1TB, and \$0.05 per GB per month after that.

<Warning>

If your account lacks sufficient funds to cover storage costs, your network volume may be terminated. Once terminated, the disk space is immediately freed for other users, and Runpod cannot recover lost data. Ensure your account remains funded to prevent data loss.

</Warning>


## High performance storage

High performance network volumes offer up to 2x faster read/write speeds compared to standard network volumes. This can reduce cold start times for Serverless workers and improve performance for Pod/Instant Clusters workflows that require reading and writing many or large files.

High performance storage costs \$0.14 per GB per month (compared to \$0.07 per GB per month for standard storage) and is available in select datacenters.

### When to use high performance storage

Use high performance network volumes when you need:

- **Faster cold starts for Serverless**: Reduce the time it takes for workers to load models and datasets from network volumes, improving response times for the first request to an endpoint.
- **Improved Instant Clusters performance**: Speed up workflows that read and write many small files, such as loading training data or checkpointing during distributed training.
- **Reduced latency**: Minimize delays when accessing data from network volumes during compute-intensive operations.

### Availability

High performance storage is currently available in the following datacenters:

| Datacenter | Region |
| ---------- | ------ |
| US-KS-2    | USA    | 
| EU-RO-1    | Europe | 
| EUR-IS-1   | Europe |

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web console">

To create a new network volume:

1. Navigate to the [Storage page](https://www.console.runpod.io/user/storage) in the Runpod console.
2. Click **New Network Volume**.
3. Select datacenter features (optional):
   - At the top of the **Datacenter** section, you can filter for datacenters that support these features:
   - [High Performance](#high-performance-storage)
   - [Global Networking](/pods/networking)
   - [S3 Compatible](/storage/s3-api).
4. Select a datacenter for your volume. Datacenter location does not affect pricing, but determines which GPU types and endpoints your network volume can be used with.
5. Provide a descriptive name for your volume (e.g., "project-alpha-data" or "shared-models").
6. Specify the desired size for the volume in gigabytes (GB).
7. Click **Create Network Volume**.

You can edit and delete your network volumes using the [Storage page](https://www.console.runpod.io/user/storage).

</Tab>

<Tab title="REST API">

To create a network volume using the REST API, send a POST request to the `/networkvolumes` endpoint:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://rest.runpod.io/v1/networkvolumes \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer RUNPOD_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "my-network-volume",
  "size": 100,
  "dataCenterId": "US-KS-2"
}'
```

For complete API documentation and parameter details, see the [network volumes API reference](/api-reference/network-volumes/POST/networkvolumes).

## Network volumes for Serverless

When attached to a Serverless endpoint, a network volume is mounted at `/runpod-volume` within the worker environment. This allows all workers on that endpoint to access shared data.

### Attach to an endpoint

To enable workers on an endpoint to use a network volume:

1. Navigate to the [Serverless section](https://www.console.runpod.io/serverless/user/endpoints) of the Runpod console.
2. Select an existing endpoint and click **Manage**, then select **Edit Endpoint**.
3. In the endpoint configuration menu, scroll down and expand the **Advanced** section.
4. Click **Network Volume** and select the network volume you want to attach to the endpoint.
5. Configure any other fields as needed, then select **Save Endpoint**.

Data from the network volume will be accessible to all workers for that endpoint from the `/runpod-volume` directory. Use this path to read and write shared data in your [handler function](/serverless/workers/handler-functions).

<Warning>

Writing to the same network volume from multiple endpoints or workers simultaneously may result in conflicts or data corruption. Ensure your application logic handles concurrent access appropriately for write operations.

</Warning>

### Benefits for Serverless

Using network volumes with Serverless provides several advantages:

- **Reduced cold starts**: Store large models or datasets on a network volume so workers can access them quickly without downloading on each cold start.
- **Cost efficiency**: Network volume storage costs less than frequently re-downloading large files.
- **Simplified data management**: Centralize your datasets and models for easier updates and management across multiple workers and endpoints.

<Note>

If you use network volumes with your Serverless endpoint, your deployments will be constrained to the datacenter where the volume is located. This may impact GPU availability and failover options.

</Note>

## Network volumes for Pods

When attached to a Pod, a network volume replaces the Pod's default volume disk and is typically mounted at `/workspace`.

<Note>
Network volumes are only available for Pods in the Secure Cloud. For more information, see [Pod types](/pods/overview#pod-types).
</Note>

### Attach to a Pod

Network volumes must be attached during Pod deployment. They cannot be attached to a previously-deployed Pod, nor can they be detached later without deleting the Pod.

To deploy a Pod with a network volume attached:

1. Navigate to the [Pods section](https://www.console.runpod.io/pods) of the Runpod console.
2. Select **Deploy**.
3. Select **Network Volume** and choose the network volume you want to attach from the dropdown list.
4. Select a GPU type. The system will automatically show which Pods are available to use with the selected network volume.
5. Select a **Pod Template**.
6. If you wish to change where the volume mounts, select **Edit Template** and adjust the **Volume Mount Path**.
7. Configure any other fields as needed, then select **Deploy On-Demand**.

Data from the network volume will be accessible to the Pod from the volume mount path (default: `/workspace`). Use this directory to upload, download, and manipulate data that you want to share with other Pods.

### Share data between Pods

You can attach a network volume to multiple Pods, allowing them to share data seamlessly. Multiple Pods can read files from the same volume concurrently, but you should avoid writing to the same file simultaneously to prevent conflicts or data corruption.



## Network volumes for Instant Clusters

Network volumes for Instant Clusters work the same way as they do for Pods. They must be attached during cluster creation, and by default are mounted at `/workspace` within each node in the cluster.

### Attach to an Instant Cluster

To enable workers on an Instant Cluster to use a network volume:

1. Navigate to the [Instant Clusters section](https://www.console.runpod.io/cluster) of the Runpod console.
2. Click **Create Cluster**.
3. Click **Network Volume** and select the network volume you want to attach to the cluster.
4. Configure any other fields as needed, then click **Deploy Cluster**.

## S3-compatible API

Runpod provides an [S3-compatible API](/storage/s3-api) that allows you to access and manage files on your network volumes directly, without needing to launch a Pod or run a Serverless worker for file management. This is particularly useful for:

- **Uploading large datasets or models** before launching compute resources.
- **Managing files remotely** without maintaining an active connection.
- **Automating data workflows** using standard S3 tools and libraries.
- **Reducing costs** by avoiding the need to keep compute resources running for file management.
- **Pre-populating volumes** to reduce worker initialization time and improve cold start performance.

The S3-compatible API supports standard S3 operations including file uploads, downloads, listing, and deletion. You can use it with popular tools like the AWS CLI and Boto3 (Python).

<Note>

The S3-compatible API is currently available for network volumes in the following datacenters: `EUR-IS-1`, `EU-RO-1`, `EU-CZ-1`, `US-KS-2`, `US-CA-2`.

</Note>


## Migrate files

You can migrate files between network volumes (including between data centers) using the following methods:

### Using runpodctl

The simplest way to migrate files between network volumes is to use `runpodctl send` and `receive` on two running Pods.

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A source network volume containing the data you want to migrate.
- A destination network volume (which can be empty or contain existing data).

<Steps>
<Step title="Deploy Pods with network volumes attached">
Deploy two Pods using the default Runpod PyTorch template. Each Pod should have one [network volume attached](#attach-to-a-pod).

1. Deploy the first Pod in the source data center and attach the source network volume.
2. Deploy the second Pod in the target data center and attach the target network volume.
3. Start the [web terminal](/pods/connect-to-a-pod#web-terminal) in both Pods.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the source volume">
Using your source Pod's web terminal, navigate to the network volume directory (usually `/workspace`):

```bash
cd workspace
```
</Step>

<Step title="Start the transfer">
Use `runpodctl send` to start the transfer. To transfer the entire volume:

```bash
runpodctl send *
```

You can also specify specific files or directories instead of `*`.
</Step>

<Step title="Copy the receive command">
After running the send command, copy the `receive` command from the output. It will look something like this:

```bash
runpodctl receive 8338-galileo-collect-fidel
```
</Step>

<Step title="Open the destination volume">
Using your destination Pod's web terminal, navigate to the network volume directory (usually `/workspace`):

```bash
cd workspace
```
</Step>

<Step title="Receive your files">
Paste and run the `receive` command you copied earlier:

```bash
runpodctl receive 8338-galileo-collect-fidel
```

The transfer will begin and show progress as it copies files from the source to the destination volume.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Using rsync over SSH

For faster migration speed and more reliability for large transfers, you can use `rsync` over SSH on two running Pods.

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A network volume in the source data center containing the data you want to migrate.
- A network volume in the target data center (which can be empty or contain existing data).

<Steps>
<Step title="Deploy Pods with network volumes attached">
Deploy two Pods using the default Runpod PyTorch template. Each Pod should have one [network volume attached](#attach-to-a-pod).

1. Deploy the first Pod in the source data center and attach the source network volume.
2. Deploy the second Pod in the target data center and attach the target network volume.
3. Start the [web terminal](/pods/connect-to-a-pod#web-terminal) in both Pods.
</Step>

<Step title="Set up SSH keys on the source Pod">
On the source Pod, install required packages and generate an SSH key pair:

```bash
apt update && apt install -y vim rsync && \
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N "" -q && \
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the public key that appears in the terminal output.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the destination Pod">
On the destination Pod, install required packages and add the source Pod's public key to `authorized_keys`:

```bash
apt update && apt install -y vim rsync && \
ip=$(printenv RUNPOD_PUBLIC_IP) && \
port=$(printenv RUNPOD_TCP_PORT_22) && \
echo "rsync -avzP --inplace -e \"ssh -p $port\" /workspace/ root@$ip:/workspace" && \
vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

In the editor that opens, paste the public key you copied from the source Pod, then save and exit (press `Esc`, type `:wq`, and press `Enter`).

The command above also displays the `rsync` command you'll need to run on the source Pod. Copy this command for the next step.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the rsync command">
On the source Pod, run the `rsync` command from the previous step. If you didn't copy it, you can construct it manually using the destination Pod's IP address and port number.

```bash
# Replace DESTINATION_PORT and DESTINATION_IP with values from the destination Pod
rsync -avzP --inplace -e "ssh -p DESTINATION_PORT" /workspace/ root@DESTINATION_IP:/workspace

# Example:
rsync -avzP --inplace -e "ssh -p 18598" /workspace/ root@157.66.254.13:/workspace
```

The `rsync` command displays progress as it transfers files. Depending on the size of your data, this may take some time.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the transfer">
After the `rsync` command completes, verify the data transfer by checking disk usage on both Pods:

```bash
du -sh /workspace
```

The destination Pod should show similar disk usage to the source Pod if all files transferred successfully.

<Tip>
You can run the `rsync` command multiple times if the transfer is interrupted. The `--inplace` flag ensures that `rsync` resumes from where it left off rather than starting over.
