[dstack](https://dstack.ai/) is an open-source tool that simplifies the orchestration of Pods for AI and ML workloads. By defining your application and resource requirements in YAML configuration files, it automates the provisioning and management of cloud resources on Runpod, allowing you to focus on your application logic rather than the infrastructure.

In this guide, we'll walk through setting up [dstack](https://dstack.ai/) with Runpod to deploy [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). We'll serve the `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` model from Hugging Face using a Python environment.

## Prerequisites

* [A Runpod account with an API key](/get-started/api-keys)

* On your local machine:

  * Python 3.8 or higher
  * `pip` (or `pip3` on macOS)
  * Basic utilities: `curl`

* These instructions are applicable for macOS, Linux, and Windows systems.

<Info>

**Windows Users**

* It's recommended to use [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or tools like [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) to follow along with the Unix-like commands used in this tutorial
* Alternatively, Windows users can use PowerShell or Command Prompt and adjust commands accordingly

### Configuring dstack for Runpod

1. **Create the Global Configuration File**

   The following `config.yml` file is a **global configuration** used by [dstack](https://dstack.ai/) for all deployments on your computer. It's essential to place it in the correct configuration directory.

   * **Create the configuration directory:**

     <Tabs>
     <Tab title="macOS">
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.dstack/server
     ```

     </Tab>

     <Tab title="Linux">
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.dstack/server
     ```

     </Tab>

     <Tab title="Windows">
     **Command Prompt or PowerShell:**

     ```bash
     mkdir %USERPROFILE%\.dstack\server
     ```

     </Tab>

     </Tabs>

   * **Navigate to the configuration directory:**

     <Tabs>
     <Tab title="macOS">
     ```bash
     cd ~/.dstack/server
     ```

     </Tab>

     <Tab title="Linux">
     ```bash
     cd ~/.dstack/server
     ```

     </Tab>

     <Tab title="Windows">
     ```bash
     cd %USERPROFILE%\.dstack\server
     ```

     </Tab>

     </Tabs>

   * **Create the `config.yml` File**

     In the configuration directory, create a file named `config.yml` with the following content:

     ```yml
     projects:
       - name: main
         backends:
           - type: runpod
             creds:
               type: api_key
               api_key: YOUR_RUNPOD_API_KEY
     ```

     Replace `YOUR_RUNPOD_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained from Runpod.

2. **Start the dstack Server**

   From the configuration directory, start the dstack server:

   ```bash
   dstack server
   ```

   You should see output indicating that the server is running:

```bash
[INFO] Applying ~/.dstack/server/config.yml...
[INFO] The admin token is ADMIN-TOKEN
[INFO] The dstack server is running at http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

<Info>

The `ADMIN-TOKEN` displayed is important for accessing the dstack web UI.

</Info>

3. **Access the dstack Web UI**

* Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
* When prompted for an admin token, enter the `ADMIN-TOKEN` from the server output.
* The web UI allows you to monitor and manage your deployments.

## Deploying vLLM as a Task

### Step 1: Configure the Deployment Task

1. **Prepare for Deployment**

* Open a new terminal or command prompt window.

* Navigate to your tutorial directory:

  ```bash
  cd runpod-dstack-tutorial
  ```

* **Activate the Python Virtual Environment**

  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Linux">
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows">
  **Command Prompt:**

  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  **PowerShell:**

  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

  </Tab>

  </Tabs>

2. **Create a Directory for the Task**

Create and navigate to a new directory for the deployment task:

```bash
mkdir task-vllm-llama
cd task-vllm-llama
```

3. **Create the dstack Configuration File**

* **Create the `.dstack.yml` File**

  Create a file named `.dstack.yml` (or `dstack.yml` if your system doesn't allow filenames starting with a dot) with the following content:

  ```yml
  type: task
  name: vllm-llama-3.1-8b-instruct
  python: "3.10"
  env:
    - HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN
    - MODEL_NAME=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
    - MAX_MODEL_LEN=8192
  commands:
    - pip install vllm
    - vllm serve $MODEL_NAME --port 8000 --max-model-len $MAX_MODEL_LEN
  ports:
    - 8000
  spot_policy: on-demand
  resources:
    gpu:
      name: "RTX4090"
      memory: "24GB"
    cpu: 16..
  ```

<Info>

Replace `YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` with your actual [Hugging Face access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) (read-access is enough) or define the token in your environment variables. Without this token, the model cannot be downloaded as it is gated.

</Info>

### Step 2: Initialize and Deploy the Task

1. **Initialize dstack**

Run the following command **in the directory where your `.dstack.yml` file is located**:

```bash
dstack init
```

2. **Apply the Configuration**

Deploy the task by applying the configuration:

```bash
dstack apply
```

* You will see an output summarizing the deployment configuration and available instances.

* When prompted:

  ```bash
  Submit the run vllm-llama-3.1-8b-instruct? [y/n]:
  ```

  Type `y` and press `Enter` to confirm.

* The `ports` configuration provides port forwarding from the deployed pod to `localhost`, allowing you to access the deployed vLLM via `localhost:8000`.

3. **Monitor the Deployment**

* After executing `dstack apply`, you'll see all the steps that dstack performs:

  * Provisioning the pod on Runpod.
  * Downloading the Docker image.
  * Installing required packages.
  * Downloading the model from Hugging Face.
  * Starting the vLLM server.

* The logs of vLLM will be displayed in the terminal.

* To monitor the logs at any time, run:

  ```bash
  dstack logs vllm-llama-3.1-8b-instruct
  ```

* Wait until you see logs indicating that vLLM is serving the model, such as:

  ```
  INFO: Started server process [1]
  INFO: Waiting for application startup.
  INFO: Application startup complete.
  INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  ```

### Step 3: Test the Model Server

1. **Access the Service**

Since the `ports` configuration forwards port `8000` from the deployed pod to `localhost`, you can access the vLLM server via `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Test the Service Using `curl`**

Use the following `curl` command to test the deployed model:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS">
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
          "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
          "messages": [
             {"role": "system", "content": "You are Poddy, a helpful assistant."},
             {"role": "user", "content": "What is your name?"}
          ],
          "temperature": 0,
          "max_tokens": 150
        }'
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Linux">
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
          "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
          "messages": [
             {"role": "system", "content": "You are Poddy, a helpful assistant."},
             {"role": "user", "content": "What is your name?"}
          ],
          "temperature": 0,
          "max_tokens": 150
        }'
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">
**Command Prompt:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"model\": \"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\", \"messages\": [ {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Poddy, a helpful assistant.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is your name?\"} ], \"temperature\": 0, \"max_tokens\": 150 }"
```

**PowerShell:**

```bash
curl.exe -Method Post http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions `
  -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
  -Body '{ "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "messages": [ {"role": "system", "content": "You are Poddy, a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is your name?"} ], "temperature": 0, "max_tokens": 150 }'
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

3. **Verify the Response**

You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "id": "chat-f0566a5143244d34a0c64c968f03f80c",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1727902323,
  "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "My name is Poddy, and I'm here to assist you with any questions or information you may need.",
        "tool_calls": []
      },
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "stop_reason": null
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 49,
    "total_tokens": 199,
    "completion_tokens": 150
  },
  "prompt_logprobs": null
}
```

This confirms that the model is running and responding as expected.

### Step 4: Clean Up

To avoid incurring additional costs, it's important to stop the task when you're finished.

1. **Stop the Task**

In the terminal where you ran `dstack apply`, you can stop the task by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

You'll be prompted:

```
Stop the run vllm-llama-3.1-8b-instruct before detaching? [y/n]:
```

Type `y` and press `Enter` to confirm stopping the task.

2. **Terminate the Instance**

The instance will terminate automatically after stopping the task.

If you wish to ensure the instance is terminated immediately, you can run:

```bash
dstack stop vllm-llama-3.1-8b-instruct
```

3. **Verify Termination**

Check your Runpod dashboard or the [dstack](https://dstack.ai/) web UI to ensure that the instance has been terminated.

## Additional Tips: Using Volumes for Persistent Storage

If you need to retain data between runs or cache models to reduce startup times, you can use volumes.

### Creating a Volume

Create a separate [dstack](https://dstack.ai/) file named `volume.dstack.yml` with the following content:

```yml
type: volume
name: llama31-volume

backend: runpod
region: EUR-IS-1

# Required size
size: 100GB
```

<Info>

The `region` ties your volume to a specific region, which then also ties your Pod to that same region.

</Info>

Apply the volume configuration:

```sh
dstack apply -f volume.dstack.yml
```

This will create the volume named `llama31-volume`.

### Using the Volume in Your Task

Modify your `.dstack.yml` file to include the volume:

```yml
volumes:
- name: llama31-volume
 path: /data
```

This configuration will mount the volume to the `/data` directory inside your container.

By doing this, you can store models and data persistently, which can be especially useful for large models that take time to download.

For more information on using volumes with Runpod, refer to the [dstack blog on volumes](https://dstack.ai/blog/volumes-on-runpod/).
