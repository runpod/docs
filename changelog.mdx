<Update label="September 2025">
## Slurm Clusters GA, cached models in beta, and new Public Endpoints

- [Slurm Clusters are now generally available](/instant-clusters/slurm-clusters) on Runpod. Deploy production-ready HPC clusters in seconds instead of hours or days. The clusters support multi-node performance for distributed training and large-scale simulations. Manage clusters from the web interface with pay-as-you-go billing and no idle costs.
- [Cached models are now in beta](/serverless/endpoints/model-caching). When enabled, this feature eliminates model download times when starting workers. Instead of embedding large models in Docker images or downloading them at startup, cached models are placed on host machines before workers start. When you specify a model from Hugging Face, the scheduler prioritizes hosts with your model already cached. If the model is cached, workers start instantly. If not, the system downloads the model before your worker starts billing.
- [New Public Endpoints](/hub/public-endpoints) are now available: Wan 2.5 combines an image and audio to create lifelike videos, and Nano Banana combines multiple images to create composite images for product placement, character development, and more.
</Update>
