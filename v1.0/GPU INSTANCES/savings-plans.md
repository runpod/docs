Savings Plans: Cost Savings for Your RunPod Deployments

Introducing Savings Plans, a powerful cost-saving feature designed to optimize your RunPod experience. With Savings Plans, you can take advantage of upfront payments to unlock discounts on uninterrupted instances, enabling you to maximize cost efficiency and get the most out of specific card types.

**Getting Started:**

To start saving with RunPod's Savings Plans, ensure you have sufficient RunPod credits in your account.

There are two ways to create a savings plan. From the pod dashboard, you can effortlessly add a Savings Plan to your existing running pod. Alternatively, you have the option to initiate a Savings Plan during the pod deployment process. Regularly check the "My Savings Plan" section to track your Savings Plans and associated pods.

**Benefits for You:**

Reduced Costs: By paying upfront for a Savings Plan, you can enjoy discounted rates on uninterrupted instances. This translates into significant cost savings for your RunPod deployments.

Flexible Savings: When you stop a pod, the Savings Plan associated with it can be applied to your next deployment of the same card. This means you continue to benefit from your savings commitment even after temporary pauses in your pod usage. **Please note that pausing/stopping your pod(s) does not extend your savings plan. The savings plan expiration date is set at purchase time.**

Instant Activation: Savings Plans kick in immediately upon activation and remain active for the duration of your committed period. You can start saving from the moment you initiate a Savings Plan.

Easy Management: Adding a Savings Plan to your existing running pod is a breeze through the pod dashboard. Alternatively, Savings Plans are automatically started when you deploy a new pod, simplifying the process and ensuring you don't miss out on potential savings.

Clear Visibility: Stay on top of your savings commitments and associated pods by navigating to the "My Savings Plan" menu option. This provides you with a comprehensive overview of your Savings Plans, enabling effective monitoring and management.

Empower your RunPod deployments with Savings Plans and unlock the potential for cost optimization and enhanced savings. Begin maximizing your RunPod experience today!
