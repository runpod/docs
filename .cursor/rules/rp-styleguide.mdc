Prefer using paragraphs to bullet points unless directly asked.
When using bullet points, end each line with a period.

## Tutorials

When creating a tutorial, always include these sections:

- What you'll learn
- Requirements (rather than "prerequisites")

Number steps like this:

"## Step 1: Create a widget"
... and so on.

Prefer using paragraphs to bullet points unless specifically requested.
