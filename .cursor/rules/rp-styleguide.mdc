Always use sentence case for headings and titles.
These are proper nouns: Pods, Serverless, Hub, Instant Clusters, Secure Cloud, Community Cloud, Tetra.
These are generic terms: endpoint, worker, cluster, template, handler, fine-tune, network volume.
Prefer using paragraphs to bullet points unless specifically requested.
When using bullet points, use hyphens instead of asterisks, and end each line with a period.
