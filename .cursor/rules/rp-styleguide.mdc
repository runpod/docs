## General

Always use sentence case for headings and titles.
These are proper nouns: Pods, Serverless, Hub, Instant Clusters, Secure Cloud, Community Cloud, Tetra.
These are generic terms: endpoint, worker, cluster, template, handler, fine-tune, network volume.
Prefer using paragraphs to bullet points unless directly asked.
When using bullet points, end each line with a period.

## Tutorials

When creating a tutorial, always include these sections:

- What you'll learn
- Requirements (rather than "prerequisites")

Number steps like this:

"## Step 1: Create a widget"
... and so on.
