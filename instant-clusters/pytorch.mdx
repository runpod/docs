This tutorial demonstrates how to use Instant Clusters with [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) to run distributed workloads across multiple GPUs. By leveraging PyTorch's distributed processing capabilities and RunPod's high-speed networking infrastructure, you can significantly accelerate your training process compared to single-GPU setups.

Follow the steps below to deploy a cluster and start running distributed PyTorch workloads efficiently.

## Step 1: Deploy an Instant Cluster

1. Open the [Instant Clusters page](https://www.runpod.io/console/cluster) on the RunPod web interface.
2. Click **Create Cluster**.
3. Use the UI to name and configure your Cluster. For this walkthrough, keep **Pod Count** at **2** and select the option for **16x H100 SXM** GPUs. Keep the **Pod Template** at its default setting (RunPod PyTorch).
4. Click **Deploy Cluster**. You should be redirected to the Instant Clusters page after a few seconds.

## Step 2: Clone the PyTorch demo into each Pod

1. Click your cluster to expand the list of Pods.

2. Click on a Pod, for example `CLUSTERNAME-pod-0`, to expand the Pod.

3. Click **Connect**, then click **Web Terminal**.

4. In the terminal that opens, run this command to clone a basic `main.py` file into the Pod's main directory:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/murat-runpod/torch-demo.git
   ```

Repeat these steps for **each Pod** in your cluster.

## Step 3: Examine the main.py file

Let's look at the code in our `main.py` file:

```python main.py
import os
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist

def init_distributed():
   """Initialize the distributed training environment"""
   # Initialize the process group
   dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl")
   
   # Get local rank and global rank
   local_rank = int(os.environ["LOCAL_RANK"])
   global_rank = dist.get_rank()
   world_size = dist.get_world_size()
   
   # Set device for this process
   device = torch.device(f"cuda:{local_rank}")
   torch.cuda.set_device(device)
       
   return local_rank, global_rank, world_size, device

def cleanup_distributed():
   """Clean up the distributed environment"""
   dist.destroy_process_group()

def main():
   # Initialize distributed environment
   local_rank, global_rank, world_size, device = init_distributed()
   
   print(f"Running on rank {global_rank}/{world_size-1} (local rank: {local_rank}), device: {device}")

   # Your code here
   
   # Clean up distributed environment when done
   cleanup_distributed()
   
if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()
```

This is the minimal code necessary for initializing a distributed environment. The `main()` function prints the local and global rank for each GPU process (this is also where you can add your own code). `LOCAL_RANK` is assigned dynamically to each process by PyTorch. All other environment variables are set automatically by RunPod during deployment.

## Step 4: Start the PyTorch process on each Pod

Run this command in the web terminal of **each Pod** to start the PyTorch process:

```bash launcher.sh
export NCCL_DEBUG=WARN
torchrun \
  --nproc_per_node=$NUM_TRAINERS \
  --nnodes=$NUM_NODES \
  --node_rank=$NODE_RANK \
  --master_addr=$MASTER_ADDR \
  --master_port=$MASTER_PORT \
torch-demo/main.py
```

This command launches eight `main.py` processes per node (one per GPU in the Pod).

After running the command on the last Pod, you should see output similar to this:

```csharp
Running on rank 8/15 (local rank: 0), device: cuda:0
Running on rank 15/15 (local rank: 7), device: cuda:7
Running on rank 9/15 (local rank: 1), device: cuda:1
Running on rank 12/15 (local rank: 4), device: cuda:4
Running on rank 13/15 (local rank: 5), device: cuda:5
Running on rank 11/15 (local rank: 3), device: cuda:3
Running on rank 14/15 (local rank: 6), device: cuda:6
Running on rank 10/15 (local rank: 2), device: cuda:2
```

The first number refers to the global rank of the thread, spanning from `0` to `WORLD_SIZE-1` (`WORLD_SIZE` = the total number of GPUs in the cluster). In our example there are two Pods of eight GPUs, so the global rank spans from 0-15. The second number is the local rank, which defines the order of GPUs within a single Pod (0-7 for this example).

The specific number and order of ranks may be different in your terminal, and the global ranks listed will be different for each Pod.

This diagram illustrates how local and global ranks are distributed across multiple Pods:

## Step 5: Clean up

If you no longer need your cluster, make sure you return to the [Instant Clusters page](https://www.runpod.io/console/cluster) and delete your cluster to avoid incurring extra charges.

<Info>

You can monitor your cluster usage and spending using the **Billing Explorer** at the bottom of the [Billing page](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/billing) section under the **Cluster** tab.

## Next steps

Now that you've successfully deployed and tested a PyTorch distributed application on an Instant Cluster, you can:

* **Adapt your own PyTorch code** to run on the cluster by modifying the distributed initialization in your scripts.
* **Scale your training** by adjusting the number of Pods in your cluster to handle larger models or datasets.
* **Try different frameworks** like [Axolotl](/instant-clusters/axolotl) for fine-tuning large language models.
* **Optimize performance** by experimenting with different distributed training strategies like Data Parallel (DP), Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), or Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP).
