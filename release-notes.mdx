<Update label="January 2026">
## GitHub release rollback GA and load balancing Serverless repos in beta

- [GitHub release rollback](/serverless/workers/github-integration#roll-back-to-a-previous-build): Roll back your Serverless endpoint to any previous build from the console. Restore an earlier version when you encounter issues without waiting for a new GitHub release.
- [Load balancing Serverless repos (beta)](/hub/publishing-guide): Load balancing endpoints are now available in the Hub. Publish or convert any listing to load balancer type by setting `"endpointType": "LB"` in your hub.json file, then deploy as a Serverless endpoint or Pod from the Hub page. Maintain a single listing for your model and let users choose their deployment method—autoscaling Serverless or dedicated Pod resources.
