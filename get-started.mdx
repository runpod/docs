If you're new to Runpod, follow this guide to learn how to create an account, deploy your first GPU Pod, and use it to execute code remotely.

## Step 1: Create an account

Start by creating a Runpod account:

1. [Sign up here](https://www.console.runpod.io/signup).
2. Verify your email address.
3. Set up two-factor authentication (recommended for security).

<Tip>

Planning to share compute resources with your team? You can convert your personal account to a team account later. See [Manage accounts](/get-started/manage-accounts) for details.

</Tip>

## Step 2: Deploy a Pod

Now that you've created your account, you're ready to deploy your first Pod:

1. Open the [Pods page](https://www.console.runpod.io/pods) in the web interface.
2. Click the **Deploy** button.
3. Select **RTX 2000 Ada** from the list of graphics cards.

4. In the **Pod Name** field, enter the name **"test-pod"**.
5. Keep all other fields (Pod Template, Instance Pricing, and GPU Count) on their default settings.
6. Click **Deploy On-Demand** to deploy and start your Pod. You'll be redirected back to the Pods page after a few seconds.

<Note>

If you haven't set up payments yet, you'll be prompted to add a payment method and purchase credits for your account.

</Note>

## Step 3: Execute code on your Pod with JupyterLab

After your Pod finishes starting up (this can take a minute or two), you're ready to connect:

1. On the [Pods page](https://www.console.runpod.io/pods), expand the Pod you just created and click the **Connect** button. If it's greyed out, your Pod hasn't finished starting up yet.

2. In the modal that opens, under **HTTP Services**, click **Jupyter Lab** to open a JupyterLab workspace on your Pod.

3. Under **Notebook**, select **Python 3 (ipykernel)**.
4. Type `print("Hello, world!")` in the first line of the notebook.
5. Click the play button to run your code.

And that's itâ€”congratulations! You just ran your first line of code on a GPU Pod.

## Step 4: Clean up

To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, follow these steps to clean up your Pod resources:

1. Return to the [Pods page](https://www.console.runpod.io/pods).
2. Click the **Stop button** (square icon) to stop your Pod.
3. Confirm by clicking the **Stop Pod** button.

You'll still be charged a small amount for storage on stopped Pods (\$0.20 per GB per month). If you don't need to retain any data on your Pod, you should terminate it completely.

To terminate your Pod:

1. Click the **Terminate** button (trash icon).
2. Confirm by clicking the **Yes** button.

<Warning>

Terminating a Pod permanently deletes all data that isn't stored in a [network volume](/pods/storage/create-network-volumes). Be sure that you've saved any data you might need to access again.

To learn more about how storage works, see the [Pod storage overview](/pods/storage/types).

</Warning>
