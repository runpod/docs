## Step 1: Create an account

Start by creating a RunPod account to access GPU Pods and Serverless compute resources:

1. [Sign up here](https://www.runpod.io/console/signup).
2. Verify your email address.
3. Set up two-factor authentication (recommended for security).

## Step 2: Deploy a Pod

Now that you've created your account, you're ready to deploy your first Pod:

1. Open the [Pods page](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods) in the web interface.
2. Click the **Deploy** button.
3. Select **RTX 2000 Ada** from the list of graphics cards.

</Frame>

4. In the **Pod Name** field, enter the name **"test-pod"**.
5. Keep all other fields (Pod Template, Instance Pricing, and GPU Count) on their default settings.
6. Click **Deploy On-Demand** to deploy and start your Pod. You'll be redirected back to the Pods page after a few seconds.

<Info>

If you haven't set up payments yet, you'll be prompted to add a payment method and purchase credits for your account.

## Step 3: Execute code on your Pod with JupyterLab

After your Pod has finished starting up (this may take a minute or two), you can connect to it:

1. On the [Pods page](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods), find the Pod you just created and click the **Connect** button. If it's greyed out, your Pod hasn't finished starting up yet.

2. In the window that opens, under **HTTP Services**, click **Jupyter Lab** to open a JupyterLab workspace on your Pod.

3. Under **Notebook**, select **Python 3 (ipykernel)**.
4. Type `print("Hello, world!")` in the first line of the notebook.
5. Click the play button to run your code.

Congratulations! You just ran your first line of code using RunPod.

## Step 4: Clean up

To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, make sure to:

1. Return to the [Pods page](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods).
2. Click the **Stop button** (square icon) to stop your Pod.
3. Confirm by clicking the **Stop Pod** button.

<Warning>

You will be charged for storage on stopped Pods. If you don't need to retain your Pod environment, you should terminate it completely.

</Warning>

To terminate your Pod:

1. Click the **Terminate** button (trash icon).
2. Confirm by clicking the **Yes** button.

<Warning>

Terminating a Pod permanently deletes all data that isn't stored in a [network volume](/pods/storage/create-network-volumes). Be sure you've saved any data you want to access again.

</Warning>

## Next steps

Now that you've learned the basics, you're ready to:

* Generate [API keys](/get-started/api-keys) for programmatic pod management.
* [Connect to RunPod](/get-started/connect-to-runpod) using the [REST API](https://rest.runpod.io/v1/docs) or [command-line interface](/runpodctl/overview) (CLI).
* [Choose the right Pod](/pods/choose-a-pod) for your workload.
* [Manage Pods](/pods/manage-pods) using the web interface and CLI.
* Build production-ready applications with [Serverless](/serverless/overview).
* Explore [tutorials](/tutorials/introduction/overview) for specific use cases.
