## How GitHub integration works

Runpod's GitHub integration simplifies your workflow by pulling your code and Dockerfile from GitHub, building the container image, storing it in Runpod's secure container registry, and deploying it to your endpoint.

## Requirements

To deploy a worker from GitHub, you need:

* A working [handler function](/serverless/workers/handler-functions) in a GitHub repository.
* A Dockerfile in your repository. See [Creating a Dockerfile](/serverless/workers/deploy#creating-a-dockerfile) for details.
* A GitHub account.

<Tip>

For an example repository containing the minimal files necessary for deployment, see [runpod-workers/worker-basic](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-basic) on GitHub.

</Tip>

## Authorizing Runpod with GitHub

Before deploying from GitHub, you need to authorize Runpod to access your repositories:

1. Open the [settings page](http://console.runpod.io/user/settings) in the Runpod console.

2. Find the **GitHub** card under **Connections** and click **Connect**.

3. Sign in using the GitHub authorization flow. This will open your GitHub account settings page.

4. Choose which repositories Runpod can access:

   * **All repositories:** Access to all current and future repositories.
   * **Only select repositories:** Choose specific repositories.

5. Click **Save**.

You can manage this connection using Runpod settings or GitHub account settings, in the **Applications** tab.

## Deploying from GitHub

To deploy a worker from a GitHub repository:

1. Go to the [Serverless section](https://www.console.runpod.io/serverless) of the Runpod console

2. Click **New Endpoint**

3. Under **Import Git Repository**, use the search bar or menu to select the repository containing your code. This menu is populated with all repos connected to your account (repos you've forked/created, or owned by your GitHub organizations).

4. Configure your deployment options:

   * **Branch:** Select which branch to deploy from.
   * **Dockerfile Path:** Specify the path to your Dockerfile (if not in root).

   Then click **Next****
5. Configure your endpoint settings:
   * Enter an **Endpoint Name**.
   * Choose your **Endpoint Type**: select **Queue** for traditional queue-based processing or **Load Balancer** for direct HTTP access (see [Load balancing endpoints](/serverless/load-balancing/overview) for details).
   * Under **GPU Configuration**, select the appropriate GPU types for your workload.
   * Configure other settings as needed (workers, timeouts, environment variables).
6. Click **Deploy Endpoint** to deploy your worker.

Runpod will build your Docker image and deploy it to your endpoint automatically. You'll be redirected to the endpoint details page when complete.

## Monitoring build status

You can monitor your build status in the **Builds** tab of your endpoint detail page. Builds progress through these statuses:

| Status    | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Pending   | Runpod is scheduling the build.                     |
| Building  | Runpod is building your container.                  |
| Uploading | Runpod is uploading your container to the registry. |
| Testing   | Runpod is testing your Serverless worker.           |
| Completed | Runpod completed the build and upload.              |
| Failed    | Something went wrong (check build logs).            |

## Updating your endpoint

When you make changes to your GitHub repository, they won't automatically be pushed to your endpoint. To trigger an update for the workers on your endpoint, create a new release for the GitHub repository.

For detailed instructions on creating releases, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).

## Managing multiple environments

GitHub integration enables streamlined development workflows by supporting multiple environments:

* Production endpoint tracking the `main` branch.
* Staging endpoint tracking the `dev` branch.

To set up multiple environments:

1. Create a new branch for your staging endpoint.
2. [Create an endpoint](#deploying-from-github) for your production branch.
3. On the Serverless page of the Runpod console, click the three dots to the top right of your production endpoint. Click **Clone Endpoint**.
4. Expand the **Repository Configuration** section and select your staging branch.
5. Click **Create Endpoint**.

Each environment maintains independent GPU and worker configurations.

## Continuous integration with GitHub Actions

You can enhance your workflow with GitHub Actions for testing before deployment:

1. Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/test-and-deploy.yml`:

   ```yml
   name: Test and Deploy

   on:
   push:
      branches: [ main ]
   pull_request:
      branches: [ main ]

   jobs:
   test-and-deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Build and push Docker image
         uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
         with:
         context: .
         push: true
         tags: [DOCKER_USERNAME]/[WORKER_NAME]:${{ github.sha }}
         
      - name: Run Tests
         uses: runpod/runpod-test-runner@v1
         with:
         image-tag: [DOCKER_USERNAME]/[WORKER_NAME]:${{ github.sha }}
         runpod-api-key: ${{ secrets.RUNPOD_API_KEY }} # Add your API key to a GitHub secret
         test-filename: .github/tests.json
         request-timeout: 300
   ```

   <Tip>

   To add your Runpod API key to a GitHub secret, see [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

   </Tip>

2. Create test cases for your repository at `.github/tests.json`:

   ```json
   [
   {
      "input": {
         "prompt": "Test input 1"
      },
      "expected_output": {
         "status": "COMPLETED"
      }
   },
   {
      "input": {
         "prompt": "Test input 2",
         "parameter": "value"
      },
      "expected_output": {
         "status": "COMPLETED"
      }
   }
   ]
   ```

## Limitations

Runpod's GitHub integration has a few limitations to be aware of:

## GitHub integration limitations

When using GitHub integration with Runpod, be aware of these important limitations:

* **Build time limit**: Builds must complete within 160 minutes (2.5 hours). Optimize your Dockerfile for efficiency with large images to avoid timeouts.
* **Image size restriction**: Docker images cannot exceed 80 GB. Plan your image requirements accordingly, particularly when including large model weights or dependencies.
* **Base image limitations**: The integration doesn't support privately hosted images as base images. Consider incorporating essential components directly into your Dockerfile instead.
* **Hardware-specific builds**: Builds requiring GPU access during construction (such as those using GPU-compiled versions of libraries like `bitsandbytes`) are not supported.
* **Platform exclusivity**: Images built through Runpod's image builder service are designed exclusively for Runpod's infrastructure and cannot be pulled or executed on other platforms.
* **Single GitHub connection**: Each Runpod account can link to only one GitHub account. This connection cannot be shared among team members, requiring separate Runpod accounts for collaborative projects.

## Disconnecting GitHub

To disconnect your GitHub account from Runpod:

1. Go to [Runpod Settings](https://www.console.runpod.io/user/settings) → **Connections** → **Edit Connection**
2. Select your GitHub account.
3. Click **Configure**.
4. Scroll down to the Danger Zone.
5. Uninstall "Runpod Inc."

## Troubleshooting deployment issues

If your worker fails to deploy or process requests:

* Check the build logs in the Runpod console for error messages.
* Verify your Dockerfile is properly configured.
* Ensure your handler function works correctly in local testing.
* Check that your repository structure matches what's expected in your Dockerfile.
* Verify you have the necessary permissions on the GitHub repository.
