After [creating a Dockerfile](/serverless/workers/create-dockerfile) for your worker, you can build the image, test it locally, and deploy it to a Serverless endpoint.

## Requirements

* A [Dockerfile](/serverless/workers/create-dockerfile) that packages your handler function.
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) installed on your development machine.
* A [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.

## Build the Docker image

From your terminal, navigate to your project directory and build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
    -t DOCKER_USERNAME/WORKER_NAME:VERSION .
```

Replace `DOCKER_USERNAME` with your Docker Hub username, `WORKER_NAME` with a descriptive name for your worker, and `VERSION` with an appropriate version tag.

<Info>

The `--platform linux/amd64` flag is required to ensure compatibility with Runpod's infrastructure.

</Info>

## Test the image locally

Before pushing it to the registry, you should test your Docker image locally:

```sh
docker run -it DOCKER_USERNAME/WORKER_NAME:VERSION
```

If your handler is properly configured with a [test input](/serverless/workers/handler-functions#local-testing), you should see it process the test input and provide output.

## Push the image to Docker Hub

Make your image available to Runpod by pushing it to Docker Hub:

```sh
# Log in to Docker Hub
docker login

# Push the image
docker push DOCKER_USERNAME/WORKER_NAME:VERSION
```

Once your image is in the Docker container registry, you can [create a Serverless endpoint](/serverless/endpoints/manage-endpoints#create-an-endpoint) through the Runpod console.

## Image versioning

For production workloads, use SHA tags for absolute reproducibility:

```sh
# Get the SHA after pushing
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' DOCKER_USERNAME/WORKER_NAME:VERSION

# Use the SHA when deploying
# DOCKER_USERNAME/WORKER_NAME:VERSION@sha256:4d3d4b3c5a5c2b3a5a5c3b2a5a4d2b3a2b3c5a3b2a5d2b3a3b4c3d3b5c3d4a3
```

Versioning best practices:

* Never rely on the `:latest` tag for production.
* Use semantic versioning AND SHA tags for clarity and reproducibility.
* Document the specific image SHA in your deployment documentation.
* Keep images as small as possible for faster startup times.

## Deploy an endpoint

<Tip>

If your files are hosted on GitHub, you can [deploy your worker directly from a GitHub repository](/serverless/workers/github-integration) through the Runpod console.

</Tip>

You can deploy your worker image directly from a Docker registry through the Runpod console:

1. Navigate to the [Serverless section](https://www.console.runpod.io/serverless) of the Runpod console.
2. Click **New Endpoint**.
3. Click **Import from Docker Registry**.
4. In the **Container Image** field, enter your Docker image URL (e.g., `docker.io/yourusername/worker-name:v1.0.0`), then click **Next**.
5. Configure your endpoint settings:
   * Enter an **Endpoint Name**.
   * Choose your **Endpoint Type**: select **Queue** for traditional queue-based processing or **Load Balancer** for direct HTTP access (see [Load balancing endpoints](/serverless/load-balancing/overview) for details).
   * Under **GPU Configuration**, select the appropriate GPU types for your workload.
   * Configure other settings as needed (workers, timeouts, environment variables).
6. Click **Deploy Endpoint** to deploy your worker.


## Troubleshoot deployment issues

If your worker fails to start or process requests:

1. Check the logs in the Runpod console for error messages.
2. Verify your handler function works correctly in local testing.
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed in the Docker image.
4. Check that your Docker image is compatible with the selected GPU type.
5. Verify your input format matches what your handler expects.
