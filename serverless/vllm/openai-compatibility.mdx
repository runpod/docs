Runpod's vLLM workers implement OpenAI API compatibility, allowing you to use familiar [OpenAI client libraries](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries) with your deployed models. This guide explains how to leverage this compatibility to integrate your models seamlessly with existing OpenAI-based applications.

## Endpoint structure

When using the OpenAI-compatible API with Runpod, your requests are directed to this base URL pattern:

```
https://api.runpod.ai/v2/ENDPOINT_ID/openai/v1
```

Replace `ENDPOINT_ID` with your Serverless endpoint ID.

## Supported APIs

The vLLM worker implements these core OpenAI API endpoints:

| Endpoint            | Description                     | Status          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `/chat/completions` | Generate chat model completions | Fully supported |
| `/completions`      | Generate text completions       | Fully supported |
| `/models`           | List available models           | Supported       |

## Model naming

The `MODEL_NAME` environment variable is essential for all OpenAI-compatible API requests. This variable corresponds to either:

1. The [Hugging Face model](https://huggingface.co/models) you've deployed (e.g., `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`).
2. A custom name if you've set `OPENAI_SERVED_MODEL_NAME_OVERRIDE` as an environment variable.

This model name is used in chat and text completion API requests to identify which model should process your request.


## Initialize the OpenAI client

Before you can send API requests, set up an OpenAI client with your Runpod API key and endpoint URL:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

MODEL_NAME = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"  # Use your deployed model

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<RUNPOD_API_KEY>",
    base_url="https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<endpoint_id>/openai/v1",
)
```

## Send requests

You can use Runpod's OpenAI-compatible API to send requests to your Runpod endpoint, enabling you to use the same client libraries and code that you use with OpenAI's services. You only need to change the base URL to point to your Runpod endpoint.

<Tip>

You can also send requests using [Runpod's native API](/serverless/vllm/vllm-requests), which provides additional flexibility and control.

### Chat completions

The `/chat/completions` endpoint is designed for instruction-tuned LLMs that follow a chat format.

#### Non-streaming request

Here's how you can make a basic chat completion request:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

MODEL_NAME = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"  # Use your deployed model

# Initialize the OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<RUNPOD_API_KEY>",
    base_url="https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<endpoint_id>/openai/v1",
)

# Chat completion request (for instruction-tuned models)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who are you?"}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=500
)

# Print the response
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

#### Response format

The API returns responses in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": "cmpl-123abc",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677858242,
  "model": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2",
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I am Mistral, an AI assistant based on the Mistral-7B-Instruct model. How can I help you today?"
      },
      "index": 0,
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 23,
    "completion_tokens": 24,
    "total_tokens": 47
  }
}
```

#### Streaming request

Streaming allows you to receive the model's output incrementally as it's generated, rather than waiting for the complete response. This real-time delivery enhances responsiveness, making it ideal for interactive applications like chatbots or for monitoring the progress of lengthy generation tasks.

```python
# Create a streaming chat completion request
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short poem about stars."}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=200,
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

# Print the streaming response
print("Response: ", end="", flush=True)
for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="", flush=True)
print()
```

### Text completions

The `/completions` endpoint is designed for base LLMs and text completion tasks.

#### Non-streaming request

Here's how you can make a text completion request:

```python
# Text completion request
response = client.completions.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    prompt="Write a poem about artificial intelligence:",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=150
)

# Print the response
print(response.choices[0].text)
```

#### Response format

The API returns responses in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": "cmpl-456def",
  "object": "text_completion",
  "created": 1677858242,
  "model": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2",
  "choices": [
    {
      "text": "In circuits of silicon and light,\nA new form of mind takes flight.\nNot born of flesh, but of human design,\nArtificial intelligence, a marvel divine.",
      "index": 0,
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "logprobs": null
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 8,
    "completion_tokens": 39,
    "total_tokens": 47
  }
}
```

#### Streaming request

```python
# Create a completion stream
response_stream = client.completions.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    prompt="Runpod is the best platform because",
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=100,
    stream=True,
)

# Stream the response
for response in response_stream:
    print(response.choices[0].text or "", end="", flush=True)
```

### List available models

The `/models` endpoint allows you to get a list of available models on your endpoint:

```python
models_response = client.models.list()
list_of_models = [model.id for model in models_response]
print(list_of_models)
```

#### Response format

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1677858242,
      "owned_by": "runpod"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Chat completion parameters

Here are all available parameters for the `/chat/completions` endpoint:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `messages` | `list[dict[str, str]]` | Required | List of messages with `role` and `content` keys. The model's chat template will be applied automatically. |
| `model` | `string` | Required | The model repo that you've deployed on your Runpod Serverless endpoint. |
| `temperature` | `float` | `0.7` | Controls the randomness of sampling. Lower values make it more deterministic, higher values make it more random. Zero means greedy sampling. |
| `top_p` | `float` | `1.0` | Controls the cumulative probability of top tokens to consider. Must be in (0, 1]. Set to 1 to consider all tokens. |
| `n` | `int` | `1` | Number of output sequences to return for the given prompt. |
| `max_tokens` | `int` | None | Maximum number of tokens to generate per output sequence. |
| `seed` | `int` | None | Random seed to use for the generation. |
| `stop` | `string` or `list[str]` | `list` | String(s) that stop generation when produced. The returned output will not contain the stop strings. |
| `stream` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to stream the response. |
| `presence_penalty` | `float` | `0.0` | Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the generated text so far. Values > 0 encourage new tokens, values < 0 encourage repetition. |
| `frequency_penalty` | `float` | `0.0` | Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in the generated text so far. Values > 0 encourage new tokens, values < 0 encourage repetition. |
| `logit_bias` | `dict[str, float]` | None | Unsupported by vLLM. |
| `user` | `string` | None | Unsupported by vLLM. |

### Additional vLLM parameters

vLLM supports additional parameters beyond the standard OpenAI API:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `best_of` | `int` | None | Number of output sequences generated from the prompt. From these `best_of` sequences, the top `n` sequences are returned. Must be ≥ `n`. Treated as beam width when `use_beam_search` is `true`. |
| `top_k` | `int` | `-1` | Controls the number of top tokens to consider. Set to -1 to consider all tokens. |
| `ignore_eos` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to ignore the EOS token and continue generating tokens after EOS is generated. |
| `use_beam_search` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to use beam search instead of sampling. |
| `stop_token_ids` | `list[int]` | `list` | List of token IDs that stop generation when produced. The returned output will contain the stop tokens unless they are special tokens. |

| `add_generation_prompt` | `bool` | `true` | Whether to add generation prompt. Read more [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating#what-are-generation-prompts). |
| `echo` | `bool` | `false` | Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion. |
| `repetition_penalty` | `float` | `1.0` | Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the prompt and generated text so far. Values > 1 encourage new tokens, values < 1 encourage repetition. |
| `min_p` | `float` | `0.0` | Minimum probability for a token to be considered. |
| `length_penalty` | `float` | `1.0` | Penalizes sequences based on their length. Used in beam search. |
| `include_stop_str_in_output` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to include the stop strings in output text. |

## Text completion parameters

Here are all available parameters for the `/completions` endpoint:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |

| `stream` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to stream the response. |
| `presence_penalty` | `float` | `0.0` | Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the generated text so far. Values > 0 encourage new tokens, values < 0 encourage repetition. |
| `frequency_penalty` | `float` | `0.0` | Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in the generated text so far. Values > 0 encourage new tokens, values < 0 encourage repetition. |
| `logit_bias` | `dict[str, float]` | None | Unsupported by vLLM. |
| `user` | `string` | None | Unsupported by vLLM. |

Text completions support the same additional vLLM parameters as chat completions (see the Additional vLLM parameters section above).

## Environment variables

Use these environment variables to customize the OpenAI compatibility:

| Variable                            | Default     | Description                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `RAW_OPENAI_OUTPUT`                 | `1` (true)  | Enables raw OpenAI SSE format for streaming. |
| `OPENAI_SERVED_MODEL_NAME_OVERRIDE` | None        | Override the model name in responses.        |
| `OPENAI_RESPONSE_ROLE`              | `assistant` | Role for responses in chat completions.      |

For a complete list of vLLM environment variables, see the [environment variables documentation](/serverless/vllm/environment-variables).

## Client libraries

The OpenAI-compatible API works with standard [OpenAI client libraries](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries):

### Python

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<RUNPOD_API_KEY>",
    base_url="https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<endpoint_id>/openai/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="<MODEL_NAME>",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
)
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "<RUNPOD_API_KEY>",
  baseURL: "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<endpoint_id>/openai/v1"
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "<MODEL_NAME>",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
    { role: "user", content: "Hello!" }
  ]
});
```

## Implementation differences

While the vLLM worker aims for high compatibility, there are some differences from OpenAI's implementation:

**Token counting** may differ slightly from OpenAI models due to different tokenizers.

**Streaming format** follows OpenAI's Server-Sent Events (SSE) format, but the exact chunking of streaming responses may vary.

**Error responses** follow a similar but not identical format to OpenAI's error responses.

**Rate limits** follow Runpod's endpoint policies rather than OpenAI's rate limiting structure.

### Current limitations

The vLLM worker has a few limitations:

* Function and tool calling APIs are not currently supported.
* Some OpenAI-specific features like moderation endpoints are not available.
* Vision models and multimodal capabilities depend on the underlying model support in vLLM.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

| Issue                     | Solution                                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Invalid model" error     | Verify your model name matches what you deployed.                      |
| Authentication error      | Check that you're using your Runpod API key, not an OpenAI key.        |
| Timeout errors            | Increase client timeout settings for large models.                     |
| Incompatible responses    | Set `RAW_OPENAI_OUTPUT=1` in your environment variables.               |
| Different response format | Some models may have different output formatting; use a chat template. |
