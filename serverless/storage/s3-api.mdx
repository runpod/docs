RunPod provides an S3-protocol compatible API that allows direct access to your [network volumes](/serverless/storage/network-volumes). This feature enables you to manage files on your network volumes without needing to launch a Pod, reducing cost and operational friction.

Pricing for S3-compatible API usage is the same as for network volumes.

## Setup and authentication

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a shared key">
    To use the S3-compatible API, you must generate a new key called a "shared key", separate from your RunPod API key.

    1. In the RunPod console, navigate to the [Settings page](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/settings).
    2. Expand the **Shared Keys** section and select **Create a shared key**.
    3. Give your key a name and select **Create**.
    4. Make a note of your access key ID and secret access key to use in the next step.

    <Warning>

    For security, RunPod will show your secret access key only once, so you may wish to save it elsewhere (e.g., in your password manager, or in a GitHub secret). Treat your secret access key like a password and don't share it with anyone.

    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure AWS CLI">
    To use the S3-compatible API with your RunPod network volumes, you must configure your AWS CLI with the RunPod shared key you created.

    1.  If you haven't already, [install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) on your local machine.
    2.  Run the command `aws configure` in your terminal.
    3.  Provide the following when prompted:
        *   **AWS Access Key ID**: Enter your RunPod shared key's access key ID.
        *   **AWS Secret Access Key**: Enter your RunPod shared key's secret access key.
        *   **Default Region name**: You can leave this blank.
        *   **Default output format**: You can leave this blank or set it to `json`.

    This will configure the AWS CLI to use your RunPod shared key by storing these details in your AWS credentials file (typically at `~/.aws/credentials`).
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the S3-compatible API

You can use the S3-compatible API to interact with your RunPod network volumes using standard S3 tools:

*   [AWS CLI commands](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/index.html).
*   [The Boto3 Python library](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html).

Core AWS CLI operations such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and `sync` function as expected.

## AWS CLI examples

When using AWS CLI commands, you must pass in the URL for the RunPod datacenter where your network volume is located using the `--endpoint-url` parameter. The URL for your datacenter uses the format `https://[DATACENTER]-s3api.runpod.dev/`, for example `https://ca-qc-1-s3api.runpod.dev/`.

Your datacenter ID can be found in the [Storage section](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/storage) of the RunPod console.

<Note>

Unlike traditional S3 key-value stores, object names in the RunPod S3-compatible API correspond to actual file paths on your network volume. Object names containing special characters (e.g., `#`) may need to be URL encoded to ensure proper processing.

</Note>

### List objects

Use `ls` to list objects in a network volume directory:

```bash
aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://[DATACENTER]-s3api.runpod.dev/ \ 
    s3://[NETWORK_VOLUME_ID]/[REMOTE_DIR]
```

### Transfer files

Use `cp` to copy a file to a network volume:

```bash
aws s3 cp --endpoint-url https://[DATACENTER]-s3api.runpod.dev/ \
    local-file.txt \
    s3://[NETWORK_VOLUME_ID]
```

Use `cp` to copy a file from a network volume to a local directory:

```bash
aws s3 cp --endpoint-url https://[DATACENTER]-s3api.runpod.dev/ \
    s3://[NETWORK_VOLUME_ID]/remote-file.txt ./[LOCAL_DIR]
```

Use `rm` to remove a file from a network volume:

```bash
aws s3 rm --endpoint-url https://[DATACENTER]-s3api.runpod.dev/ \
    s3://[NETWORK_VOLUME_ID]/remote-file.txt
```

### Sync directories

This command syncs a local directory (source) to a network volume directory (destination):

```bash
aws s3 sync --endpoint-url https://[DATACENTER]-s3api.runpod.dev/ \
    ./[LOCAL_DIR] \
    s3://[NETWORK_VOLUME_ID]/[REMOTE_DIR]
```

## Boto3 Python example

You can also use the Boto3 library to interact with the S3-compatible API, using it to transfer files to and from a RunPod network volume.

The script below demonstrates how to upload a file to a RunPod network volume using the Boto3 library. It takes command-line arguments for the network volume ID (as an S3 bucket), the datacenter-specific S3 endpoint URL, the local file path, the desired object (file path on the network volume), and the AWS Region (which corresponds to the RunPod datacenter ID).

Your RunPod shared key credentials must be set as environment variables:

*   `RUNPOD_USER_EMAIL`: Should be set to your RunPod account email.
*   `RUNPOD_S3_API_KEY`: Should be set to your RunPod shared key's secret access key.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import argparse
import boto3 # AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with RunPod S3-compatible APIs

def create_s3_client(region: str, endpoint_url: str):
    
    # Creates and returns an S3 client configured for RunPod network volume S3-compatible API.
    #
    # Args:

    #                       (e.g., 'https://ca-qc-1-s3api.runpod.dev/').

    # Returns:

    aws_secret_access_key = os.environ.get("RUNPOD_S3_API_KEY")

    # Ensure necessary shared key credentials are set in the environment
    if not aws_access_key_id or not aws_secret_access_key:
        raise EnvironmentError(
            "Please set RUNPOD_USER_EMAIL (with Shared Key Access Key) and "
            "RUNPOD_S3_API_KEY (with Shared Key Secret Access Key) environment variables. "
            "These are obtained from 'Shared Keys' in the RunPod console settings."
        )

    # Initialize and return the S3 client for RunPod's S3-compatible API
    return boto3.client(
        "s3",
        aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,
        aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key,
        region_name=region, # Corresponds to the RunPod datacenter ID
        endpoint_url=endpoint_url, # Datacenter-specific S3 API endpoint
    )

def put_object(s3_client, bucket_name: str, object_name: str, file_path: str):
    
    # Uploads a local file to the specified RunPod network volume.
    #
    # Args:

    #   bucket_name (str): The ID of the target RunPod network volume.
    #   object_name (str): The desired file path for the object on the network volume.
    #   file_path (str): The local path to the file that needs to be uploaded.

    try:
        # Attempt to upload the file to the RunPod network volume.
        s3_client.upload_file(file_path, bucket_name, object_name)
        print(f"Successfully uploaded '{file_path}' to Network Volume '{bucket_name}' as '{object_name}'")
    except Exception as e:

        raise

def main():
    
    # Parses command-line arguments and orchestrates the file upload process

Example usage:

```bash
./s3_example_put.py --endpoint https://ca-mtl-1-s3api.runpod.io/ \
    --region 'ca-mtl-1' \
    --bucket 'network_volume_id' \
    --object 'path/to/model_file.bin' \
    --file 'model_file.bin'
```

## Supported S3 actions

The S3-compatible API supports the following operations. For detailed information on each, refer to the [AWS S3 API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Operations_Amazon_Simple_Storage_Service.html).

| Operation                 | Description                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `CopyObject`             | Copy objects between locations.              |
| `DeleteObject`           | Remove objects.                              |
| `GetObject`              | Download objects.                            |
| `HeadBucket`             | Verify bucket exists and you have permissions. |
| `HeadObject`             | Retrieve object metadata.                    |
| `ListBuckets`            | List available buckets.                      |
| `ListObjects`            | List objects in a bucket.                    |
| `PutObject`              | Upload objects.                              |
| `CreateMultipartUpload` | Start a multipart upload for large files.    |
| `UploadPart`             | Upload a part of a multipart upload.         |
| `CompleteMultipartUpload`| Finish a multipart upload.                   |
| `AbortMultipartUpload`  | Cancel a multipart upload.                   |
| `ListMultipartUploads`  | View in-progress multipart uploads.          |

Large file handling is supported through multipart uploads, allowing you to transfer files larger than 5GB.

## Known limitations

-   **Multipart uploads**:
    -   Parts from multipart uploads are stored on disk until either `CompleteMultipartUpload` or `AbortMultipartUpload` is called.
    -   The S3-compatible API enforces the 5GB maximum single file part upload size, but not the 5TB maximum file size.
    -   The 5MB minimum part size for multipart uploads is not enforced.
-   **Storage capacity**: Network volumes have a fixed storage capacity, unlike the virtually unlimited storage of standard S3 buckets. The `CopyObject` and `UploadPart` actions do not check for available free space beforehand and may fail if the volume runs out of space. This behavior is similar to applying a size quota in S3.
-   **Object names**: Unlike traditional S3 key-value stores, object names in the RunPod S3-compatible API correspond to actual file paths on your network volume. Object names containing special characters (e.g., `#`) may need to be URL encoded to ensure proper processing.
-   **Time synchronization**: Requests that are out of time sync by 1 hour will be rejected. This is more lenient than the 15-minute window specified by the AWS SigV4 authentication specification.
