---

Runpod provides an S3-protocol compatible API for direct access to your [network volumes](/serverless/storage/network-volumes). This allows you to manage files on your network volumes without launching a Pod, reducing cost and operational friction.

Using the S3-compatible API does not affect pricing. Network volumes are billed hourly at \$0.07/GB/month for the first 1TB, and \$0.05/GB/month for additional storage.

## Datacenter availability

The S3-compatible API is available for network volumes in select datacenters. Each datacenter has a unique endpoint URL that you'll use when calling the API:

| Datacenter | Endpoint URL |
|------------|--------------|
| `EUR-IS-1` | `https://s3api-eur-is-1.runpod.io/` |
| `EU-RO-1`  | `https://s3api-eu-ro-1.runpod.io/`  |
| `EU-CZ-1`  | `https://s3api-eu-cz-1.runpod.io/`  |
| `US-KS-2`  | `https://s3api-us-ks-2.runpod.io/`  |

Create your network volume in a supported datacenter to use the S3-compatible API.

## Setup and authentication

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a network volume">
    First, create a network volume in a [supported datacenter](#datacenter-availability). See [Network volumes -> Create a network volume](/serverless/storage/network-volumes#create-a-network-volume) for detailed instructions.
</Step>

<Step title="Create an S3 API key">
    Next, you'll need to generate a new key called an "S3 API key" (this is separate from your Runpod API key).

    1. Go to the [Settings page](https://www.console.runpod.io/user/settings) in the Runpod console.
    2. Expand **S3 API Keys** and select **Create an S3 API key**.
    3. Name your key and select **Create**.
    4. Save the **access key** (e.g., `user_***...`) and **secret** (e.g., `rps_***...`) to use in the next step.

    <Warning>

    For security, Runpod will show your API key secret only once, so you may wish to save it elsewhere (e.g., in your password manager, or in a GitHub secret). Treat your API key secret like a password and don't share it with anyone.

    </Warning>
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure AWS CLI">

    To use the S3-compatible API with your Runpod network volumes, you must configure your AWS CLI with the Runpod S3 API key you created.

    1.  If you haven't already, [install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) on your local machine.
    2.  Run the command `aws configure` in your terminal.
    3.  Provide the following when prompted:
        *   **AWS Access Key ID**: Enter your Runpod user ID. You can find this in the [Secrets section](https://www.console.runpod.io/user/secrets) of the Runpod console, in the description of your S3 API key. By default, the description will look similar to: `Shared Secret for user_2f21CfO73Mm2Uq2lEGFiEF24IPw 1749176107073`. `user_2f21CfO73Mm2Uq2lEGFiEF24IPw` is the user ID (yours will be different).
        *   **AWS Secret Access Key**: Enter your Runpod S3 API key's secret access key.
        *   **Default Region name**: You can leave this blank.
        *   **Default output format**: You can leave this blank or set it to `json`.

    This will configure the AWS CLI to use your Runpod S3 API key by storing these details in your AWS credentials file (typically at `~/.aws/credentials`).
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the S3-compatible API

You can use the S3-compatible API to interact with your Runpod network volumes using standard S3 tools:

*   [AWS s3 CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/index.html).
*   [AWS s3api CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/).
*   [The Boto3 Python library](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html).

Core AWS CLI operations such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and `sync` function as expected.

## s3 CLI examples

When using `aws s3` commands, you must pass in the [endpoint URL](#datacenter-availability) for your network volume using the `--endpoint-url` flag and the datacenter ID using the `--region` flag.

<Warning>
The `--region` flag is case-sensitive. For instance, `--region EU-RO-1` is a valid input, whereas `--region eu-ro-1` will be rejected.
</Warning>

Unlike traditional S3 key-value stores, object names in the Runpod S3-compatible API correspond to actual file paths on your network volume. Object names containing special characters (e.g., `#`) may need to be URL-encoded to ensure proper processing.

### List objects

Use `ls` to list objects in a network volume directory:

```bash
aws s3 ls --region [DATACENTER] \
    --endpoint-url https://s3api-[DATACENTER].runpod.io/ \ 
    s3://[NETWORK_VOLUME_ID]/[REMOTE_DIR]
```

Unlike standard S3 buckets, `ls` and `ListObjects` operations will list empty directories.

<Warning>
`ls` operations may take a long time when used on a directory containing many files (over 10,000) or large amounts of data (over 10GB), or when used recursively on a network volume containing either.
</Warning>



### Transfer files

Use `cp` to copy a file to a network volume:

```bash
aws s3 cp --region [DATACENTER] \
    --endpoint-url https://s3api-[DATACENTER].runpod.io/ \
    [LOCAL_FILE] \
    s3://[NETWORK_VOLUME_ID]
```

Use `cp` to copy a file from a network volume to a local directory:

```bash
aws s3 cp --region [DATACENTER] \
    --endpoint-url https://s3api-[DATACENTER].runpod.io/ \
    s3://[NETWORK_VOLUME_ID]/remote-file.txt ./[LOCAL_DIR]
```

Use `rm` to remove a file from a network volume:

```bash
aws s3 rm --region [DATACENTER] \
    --endpoint-url https://s3api-[DATACENTER].runpod.io/ \
    s3://[NETWORK_VOLUME_ID]/remote-file.txt
```

<Tip>

If you encounter a 502 "bad gateway" error during file transfer, try increasing `AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS` to 10 or more:

```bash
export AWS_RETRY_MODE=standard
export AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS=10
```

</Tip>

### Sync directories

This command syncs a local directory (source) to a network volume directory (destination):

```bash
aws s3 sync --region [DATACENTER] \
    --endpoint-url https://s3api-[DATACENTER].runpod.io/ \
    ./[LOCAL_DIR] \
    s3://[NETWORK_VOLUME_ID]/[REMOTE_DIR]
```

## s3api CLI example

You can also use `aws s3api` commands (instead of the `aws s3`) to interact with the S3-compatible API.

For example, here's how you could use `aws s3api get-object` to download an object from a network volume:

```bash
aws s3api get-object --bucket [NETWORK_VOLUME_ID] \
    --key [REMOTE_FILE] \
    --region [DATACENTER] \
    --endpoint-url https://s3api-[DATACENTER].runpod.io/ \
    [LOCAL_FILE]
```

Replace `[LOCAL_FILE]` with the desired path and name of the file after downloadâ€”for example: `~/local-dir/my-file.txt`.

For a list of available `s3api` commands, see the [AWS s3api reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/).

## Boto3 Python example

You can also use the Boto3 library to interact with the S3-compatible API, using it to transfer files to and from a Runpod network volume.

The script below demonstrates how to upload a file to a Runpod network volume using the Boto3 library. It takes command-line arguments for the network volume ID (as an S3 bucket), the datacenter-specific S3 endpoint URL, the local file path, the desired object (file path on the network volume), and the AWS Region (which corresponds to the Runpod datacenter ID).

Your Runpod S3 API key credentials must be set as environment variables using the values from the [Setup and authentication](#setup-and-authentication) step:

*   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Should be set to your Runpod S3 API key **access key** (e.g., `user_***...`).
*   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Should be set to your Runpod S3 API key's **secret** (e.g., `rps_***...`).




```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os

import boto3 # AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with Runpod S3-compatible APIs

def create_s3_client(region: str, endpoint_url: str):

    # Creates and returns an S3 client configured for Runpod network volume S3-compatible API.
    #
    # Args:

    client = create_s3_client(args.region, args.endpoint)

    # Upload the object to the specified network volume.
    put_object(client, args.bucket, args.object, args.file)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When uploading files with Boto3, you must specify the complete file path (including the filename) for both source and destination files.

For example, for the `put_objects` method above, you must specify these arguments:

- `file_path`: The local source file (e.g., `local_directory/file.txt`).
- `object_name`: The remote destination file to be created on the network volume (e.g., `remote_directory/file.txt`).

With that in mind, here's an example of how to run the script above using command-line arguments:

```bash
./s3_example_put.py --endpoint https://s3api-eur-is-1.runpod.io/ \
    --region 'EUR-IS-1' \
    --bucket 'network_volume_id' \
    --object 'remote_directory/file.txt' \
    --file 'local_directory/file.txt'
```

## Supported S3 actions

The S3-compatible API supports the following operations. For detailed information on each, refer to the [AWS S3 API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Operations_Amazon_Simple_Storage_Service.html).

| Operation                 | Description                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `CopyObject`             | Copy objects between locations.              |
| `DeleteObject`           | Remove objects.                              |
| `GetObject`              | Download objects.                   |
| `HeadBucket`             | Verify bucket exists and you have permissions. |
| `HeadObject`             | Retrieve object metadata.                    |
| `ListBuckets`            | List available buckets.                      |
| `ListObjects`            | List objects in a bucket. Unlike standard S3, this includes empty directories.                    |
| `PutObject`              | Upload objects (\<500MB).                       |
| `CreateMultipartUpload` | Start a multipart upload for large files.    |
| `UploadPart`             | Upload a part of a multipart upload.         |
| `CompleteMultipartUpload`| Finish a multipart upload.                   |
| `AbortMultipartUpload`  | Cancel a multipart upload.                   |
| `ListMultipartUploads`  | View in-progress multipart uploads.          |

Files larger than 500MB must be uploaded using multipart uploads.

<Warning>

`ListObjects` operations may take a long time when used on a directory containing many files (over 10,000) or large amounts of data (over 10GB), or when used recursively on a network volume containing either.

</Warning>


## Known issues and limitations

### ListObjects runs slowly or fails with "same next token" error

When running `aws s3 ls` or `ListObjects` on a directory with many files or large amounts of data (typically >10,000 files or >10 GB of data) for the first time, it may run very slowly, or you may encounter the following error: 

```bash
"fatal error: Error during pagination: The same next token was received twice: ..."
```

This occurs because Runpod must compute and cache the MD5 checksum (i.e., ETag) for files created without the S3-compatible API. This computation can take several minutes for large directories or files, as the `ListObjects` request must wait until the checksum is ready.

Workarounds:
* The operation will typically complete successfully if you wait for the process to finish.
* If the client aborts with a pagination error, retry the operation after a brief pause.

### Storage and time synchronization

-   **Storage capacity**: Network volumes have a fixed storage capacity, unlike the virtually unlimited storage of standard S3 buckets. The `CopyObject` and `UploadPart` actions do not check for available free space beforehand and may fail if the volume runs out of space.
-   **Maximum file size**: 4TB (the maximum size of a network volume).
-   **Object names**: Unlike traditional S3 key-value stores, object names in the Runpod S3-compatible API correspond to actual file paths on your network volume. Object names containing special characters (e.g., `#`) may need to be URL encoded to ensure proper processing.
-   **Time synchronization**: Requests that are out of time sync by 1 hour will be rejected. This is more lenient than the 15-minute window specified by the AWS SigV4 authentication specification.

### Multipart uploads

-   The maximum size for a single part of a multipart upload is 500MB.
-   The AWS S3 minimum part size of 5MB is not enforced.
-   Multipart upload parts and metadata are stored in a hidden `.s3compat_uploads/` folder. This folder and its contents are automatically cleaned up when you call `CompleteMultipartUpload` or `AbortMultipartUpload`.

### Unsupported S3 features

-   Object versioning.
-   Object encryption.
-   Object tagging.
-   Object ACLs.
-   Object locking.
-   Website redirects.
-   Storage classes besides `STANDARD`.
