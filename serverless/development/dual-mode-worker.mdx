Developing machine learning and AI applications often requires powerful GPUs, making local development of API endpoints challenging. A typical development workflow for [Serverless](/serverless/overview) would be to write your handler code, deploy it directly to a Serverless endpoint, send endpoint requests to test, debug using worker logs, and repeat.

This can have signifcant drawbacks, such as:

*   **Slow iteration**: Each deployment requires a new build and test cycle, which can be time-consuming.
*   **Limited visibility**: Logs and errors are not always easy to debug, especially when running in a remote environment.
*   **Resource constraints**: Your local machine may not have the necessary resources to test your application.

This tutorial shows how to build a "Pod-first" development environment: creating a flexible, dual-mode Docker image that can be deployed as either a Pod or a Serverless worker.

Using this method, you'll leverage a [Pod](/pods/overview)—a GPU instance ideal for interactive development, with tools like Jupyter Notebooks and direct IDE integration—as your cloud-based development machine. The Pod will be deployed with a flexible Docker base, allowing the same container image to be seamlessly deployed to a Serverless endpoint.

This workflow lets you develop and thoroughly test your application using a containerized Pod environment, ensuring it works correctly. Then, when you're ready to deploy to production, you can deploy it instantly to Serverless.

Follow the steps below to create a worker image that leverages this flexibility, allowing for faster iteration and more robust deployments.

<Tip>

To get a basic dual-mode worker up and running immediately, you can [clone this repository](https://github.com/justinwlin/Runpod-GPU-And-Serverless-Base) and use it as a base.

</Tip>

## What you'll learn

In this tutorial you'll learn how to:

*   Set up a project for a dual-mode Serverless worker.
*   Create a handler file (`handler.py`) that adapts its behavior based on a user-specified environment variable.
*   Write a startup script (`start.sh`) to manage different operational modes.
*   Build a Docker image designed for flexibility.
*   Understand and utilize the "Pod-first" development workflow.
*   Deploy and test your worker in both Pod and Serverless environments.

## Requirements

*   You've [created a Runpod account](/get-started/manage-accounts).
*   You've installed [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) on your local machine and configured them for your command line.
*   Basic understanding of Docker concepts and shell scripting.

## Step 1: Set up your project structure

First, create a directory for your project and the necessary files.

    Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
mkdir dual-mode-worker
cd dual-mode-worker
touch handler.py start.sh Dockerfile requirements.txt
```

This creates:

- `handler.py`: Your Python script with the Runpod handler logic.
- `start.sh`: A shell script that will be the entrypoint for your Docker container.
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions to build your Docker image.
- `requirements.txt`: A file to list Python dependencies.

## Step 2: Create the `handler.py` file

This Python script will contain your core logic. It will check for a user-specified environment variable `MODE_TO_RUN` to determine whether to run in Pod or Serverless mode.

Add the following code to `handler.py`:

```python
import os
import asyncio
import runpod

# Use the MODEL environment variable; fallback to a default if not set
mode_to_run = os.getenv("MODE_TO_RUN", "pod")
model_length_default = 25000

print("------- ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES -------")
print("Mode running: ", mode_to_run)
print("------- -------------------- -------")

async def handler(event):
    inputReq = event.get("input", {})
    return inputReq

if mode_to_run == "pod":
    async def main():
        prompt = "Hello World"
        requestObject = {"input": {"prompt": prompt}}
        response = await handler(requestObject)
        print(response)

    asyncio.run(main())
else: 
    runpod.serverless.start({
        "handler": handler,
        "concurrency_modifier": adjust_concurrency,
    })

```

Key features:

*   `MODE_TO_RUN = os.getenv("MODE_TO_RUN", "pod")`: Reads the mode from an environment variable, defaulting to `pod`.
*   `async def handler(event)`: Your core logic.
*   `if mode_to_run == "pod" ... else`: This conditional controls what happens when the script is executed directly.
    *   In `pod` mode, it runs a sample test call to your `handler` function, allowing for quick iteration.
    *   In `serverless`" mode, it starts the Runpod Serverless worker.

## Step 3: Create the `start.sh` script

This script will be the entrypoint for your Docker container. It reads the `MODE_TO_RUN` environment variable and configures the container accordingly.

Add the following code to `start.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit the script if any statement returns a non-true return value

# Set workspace directory from env or default
WORKSPACE_DIR="${WORKSPACE_DIR:-/workspace}"

# Start nginx service
start_nginx() {
    echo "Starting Nginx service..."
    service nginx start
}

# Execute script if exists
execute_script() {
    local script_path=$1
    local script_msg=$2
    if [[ -f ${script_path} ]]; then
        echo "${script_msg}"
        bash ${script_path}
    fi
}

# Setup ssh
setup_ssh() {
    if [[ $PUBLIC_KEY ]]; then
        echo "Setting up SSH..."
        mkdir -p ~/.ssh
        echo "$PUBLIC_KEY" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        chmod 700 -R ~/.ssh
        # Generate SSH host keys if not present
        generate_ssh_keys
        service ssh start
        echo "SSH host keys:"
        cat /etc/ssh/*.pub
    fi
}

# Generate SSH host keys
generate_ssh_keys() {
    ssh-keygen -A
}

# Export env vars
export_env_vars() {
    echo "Exporting environment variables..."
    printenv | grep -E '^RUNPOD_|^PATH=|^_=' | awk -F = '{ print "export " $1 "=\"" $2 "\"" }' >> /etc/rp_environment
    echo 'source /etc/rp_environment' >> ~/.bashrc
}

# Start jupyter lab
start_jupyter() {
    echo "Starting Jupyter Lab..."
    mkdir -p "$WORKSPACE_DIR" && \
    cd / && \
    nohup jupyter lab --allow-root --no-browser --port=8888 --ip=* --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password='' --FileContentsManager.delete_to_trash=False --ServerApp.terminado_settings='{"shell_command":["/bin/bash"]}' --ServerApp.allow_origin=* --ServerApp.preferred_dir="$WORKSPACE_DIR" &> /jupyter.log &
    echo "Jupyter Lab started without a password"
}

# Call Python handler if mode is serverless or both
call_python_handler() {
    echo "Calling Python handler.py..."
    python $WORKSPACE_DIR/handler.py
}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#                               Main Program                                   #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

start_nginx

echo "Pod Started"

setup_ssh

case $MODE_TO_RUN in
    serverless)
        echo "Running in serverless mode"
        call_python_handler
        ;;
    pod)
        echo "Running in pod mode"
        start_jupyter
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid MODE_TO_RUN value: $MODE_TO_RUN. Expected 'serverless', 'pod', or 'both'."
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

export_env_vars

echo "Start script(s) finished"

sleep infinity

```
Key features:
*   `case $MODE_TO_RUN in ... esac`: This structure directs the startup based on the mode.
*   `serverless` mode: Executes `handler.py`, which then starts the Runpod Serverless worker. `exec` replaces the shell process with the Python process.
*   `pod` mode: Starts up the JupyterLab server for Pod development, then runs `sleep infinity` to keep the container alive so you can connect to it (e.g., via SSH or `docker exec`). You would then manually run `python /app/handler.py` inside the Pod to test your handler logic.

## Step 4: Create the `Dockerfile`

This file defines how to build your Docker image.

Add the following content to `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Runpod base image
FROM runpod/pytorch:2.0.1-py3.10-cuda11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04

# Environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 

# Supported modes: pod, serverless
ARG MODE_TO_RUN=pod
ENV MODE_TO_RUN=$MODE_TO_RUN

# Set up the working directory
ARG WORKSPACE_DIR=/app
ENV WORKSPACE_DIR=${WORKSPACE_DIR}
WORKDIR $WORKSPACE_DIR

# Install dependencies in a single RUN command to reduce layers and clean up in the same layer to reduce image size
RUN apt-get update --yes --quiet && \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install --yes --quiet --no-install-recommends \
    software-properties-common \
    gpg-agent \
    build-essential \
    apt-utils \
    ca-certificates \
    curl && \
    add-apt-repository --yes ppa:deadsnakes/ppa && \
    apt-get update --yes --quiet && \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install --yes --quiet --no-install-recommends

# Create and activate a Python virtual environment
RUN python3 -m venv /app/venv
ENV PATH="/app/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Install Python packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
    asyncio \
    requests \
    runpod

# Install requirements.txt
COPY requirements.txt ./requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    
# Delete's the default start.sh file from Runpod (so we can replace it with our own below)
RUN rm ../start.sh

# Copy all of our files into the container
COPY handler.py $WORKSPACE_DIR/handler.py
COPY start.sh $WORKSPACE_DIR/start.sh

# Make sure start.sh is executable
RUN chmod +x start.sh

# Make sure that the start.sh is in the path
RUN ls -la $WORKSPACE_DIR/start.sh

# depot build -t justinrunpod/pod-server-base:1.0 . --push --platform linux/amd64
CMD $WORKSPACE_DIR/start.sh
```
Key features:
*   `FROM runpod/pytorch:2.0.1-py3.10-cuda11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04`: Starts with a Runpod base image that comes with nginx, runpodctl, and other helpful base packages.
*   `ARG WORKSPACE_DIR=/workspace` and `ENV WORKSPACE_DIR=${WORKSPACE_DIR}`: Allows the workspace directory to be set at build time.
*   `WORKDIR $WORKSPACE_DIR`: Sets the working directory to the value of `WORKSPACE_DIR`.
*   `COPY requirements.txt ./requirements.txt` and `RUN pip install ...`: Installs Python dependencies.
*   `COPY . .`: Copies all application files into the workspace directory.
*   `ENV MODE_TO_RUN="pod"`: Sets the default operational mode to "pod". This can be overridden at runtime.
*   `CMD ["$WORKSPACE_DIR/start.sh"]`: Specifies `start.sh` as the command to run when the container starts.

## Step 5: Build and push your Docker image

<Info>

Instead of building and pushing your image via Docker Hub, you can also [deploy your worker from a GitHub repository](/serverless/workers/github-integration).

</Info>

Now, build your Docker image and push it to a container registry like Docker Hub.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build your Docker image">
    Build your Docker image, replacing `[YOUR_USERNAME]` with your Docker Hub username and choosing a suitable image name:
    
    ```sh
    docker build --platform linux/amd64 --tag [YOUR_USERNAME]/dual-mode-worker .
    ```
    The `--platform linux/amd64` flag is important for compatibility with Runpod's infrastructure.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Push the image to your container registry">
    ```sh
    docker push [YOUR_USERNAME]/dual-mode-worker:latest
    ```
    <Note>

    You might need to run `docker login` first.

    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Testing in Pod mode

Now that you've finished building our Docker image, let's explore how you would use the Pod-first development workflow in practice.

Deploy the image to a Pod by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Pods page](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods) in the Runpod console and click **Create Pod**.
2. Choose a GPU.
3. For "Docker Image Name", enter `[YOUR_USERNAME]/dual-mode-worker:latest`.
4. Under **Pod Template**, select **Edit Template**.
5. Under **Public Environment Variables**, select **Add environment variable**. Set variable key to **`MODE_TO_RUN`** and the value to **`pod`**.
6. Select **Set Overrides**, then deploy your Pod.

After [connecting to the Pod](/pods/connect-to-pod), navigate to `/app` and run your handler directly:

```sh
python handler.py
```

This will execute the Pod-specific test harness in your `handler.py`, giving you immediate feedback. You can edit `handler.py` within the Pod and re-run it for rapid iteration.

## Step 7: Deploy to a Serverless endpoint

Once you're confident with your `handler.py` logic tested in Pod mode, you're ready to deploy your dual-mode worker to a Serverless endpoint.

1. Go to the [Serverless section](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless) of the Runpod console.
2. Click **New Endpoint**.
3. Under **Custom Source**, select **Docker Image**, then select **Next**.
4. In the **Container Image** field, enter your Docker image URL: `docker.io/[YOUR_USERNAME]/dual-mode-worker:latest`.
5. Under **Advanced Settings > Environment Variables**, set `MODE_TO_RUN` to `serverless`.
6. Configure GPU, workers, and other settings as needed.
7. Select **Create Endpoint**.

The *same* image is used, but `start.sh` will now direct it to run in Serverless mode, starting the `runpod.serverless.start` worker.

## Step 8: Test your endpoint

After deploying your endpoint in to Serverless mode, you can test it with the following steps:

1.  Navigate to your endpoint's detail page in the Runpod console.
2.  Click the **Requests** tab.
3.  Use the following JSON as test input:
```json
{
    "input": {
        "prompt": "Hello World!",
    }
}
```
4.  Click **Run**.

After a few moments for initialization and processing, you should see output similar to this:

```json
{
    "delayTime": 12345, // This will vary
    "executionTime": 3050, // This will be around 3000ms + overhead
    "id": "some-unique-id",
    "output": {
        "output": "Processed prompt: 'Hello Serverless World!' after 3s in Serverless mode."
    },
    "status": "COMPLETED"
}
```

## Explore the Pod-first development workflow

Congratulations! You've successfully built, deployed, and tested a dual-mode Serverless worker. Now, let's explore the recommended iteration process for a Pod-first development workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Develop using Pod mode">
    1. Deploy your initial Docker image to a Runpod Pod, ensuring `MODE_TO_RUN` is set to `pod` (or rely on the Dockerfile default).
    2. [Connect to your Pod](/pods/connect-to-pod) (via SSH or web terminal).
    3. Navigate to the `/app` directory.
    4. As you develop, install any necessary Python packages (`pip install [PACKAGE_NAME]`) or system dependencies (`apt-get install [PACKAGE_NAME]`).
    5. Iterate on your `handler.py` script. Test your changes frequently by running `python handler.py` directly in the Pod's terminal. This will execute the test harness you defined in the `elif MODE_TO_RUN == "pod":` block, giving you immediate feedback.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update your Docker image">
    Once you're satisfied with a set of changes and have new dependencies:
    1. Add new Python packages to your `requirements.txt` file.
    2. Add system installation commands (e.g., `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y [PACKAGE_NAME]`) to your `Dockerfile`.
    3. Ensure your updated `handler.py` is saved.
   
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy and test in Serverless mode">

    1. Deploy your worker image to a Serverless endpoint using [Docker Hub](/serverless/workers/deploy) or [GitHub](/serverless/workers/github-integration).
    2. During deployment, ensure that the `MODE_TO_RUN` environment variable for the endpoint is set to `serverless`.

    <Note>

    For instructions on how to set environment variables during deployment, see [Manage endpoints](/serverless/endpoints/manage-endpoints).

    </Note>

    3. After your endpoint is deployed, you can test it by [sending API requests](/serverless/endpoints/send-requests).
  </Step>
</Steps>

This iterative loop—write your handler, update the Docker image, test in Pod mode, then deploy to Serverless—allows for rapid development and debugging of your Serverless workers.
