Runpod provides comprehensive logging capabilities for Serverless endpoints and workers. You can view real-time and historical logs through the Runpod console to help you monitor, debug, and troubleshoot your applications.

To learn how to write logs from your handler functions, see [Write logs](/serverless/development/write-logs).

## Endpoint logs

<Note>
Endpoint logs are retained for 90 days, after which they are automatically removed from the system. If you need to retain logs indefinitely, you can [write them to a network volume](#persistent-log-storage) or an external service.
</Note>

Endpoint logs are automatically collected from your worker instances and streamed to Runpod's centralized logging system. These logs include:

- **Standard output (stdout)** from your handler functions.
- **Standard error (stderr)** from your applications.
- **System messages** related to worker lifecycle events.
- **Framework logs** from the Runpod SDK. To learn more about the Runpod logging library, see the [Runpod SDK documentation](/tutorials/sdks/python/101/error).

Logs are streamed in near real-time with only a few seconds of lag. 

<Warning>
If your worker generates excessive output, logs may be throttled and dropped to prevent system overload. See [Log throttling](#log-throttling) for more information.
</Warning>

To view endpoint logs:

1. Navigate to your Serverless endpoint in the [Runpod console](https://console.runpod.io/serverless).
2. Click on the **Logs** tab.
3. View real-time and historical logs.
4. Use the search and filtering capabilities to find specific log entries.
5. Download logs as text files for offline analysis.

## Worker logs

Worker logs are temporary logs that exist only on the specific server where the worker is running. These logs are not throttled, but are not persistent, and are removed when a worker terminates.

To view worker logs:

1. Navigate to your Serverless endpoint in the [Runpod console](https://console.runpod.io/serverless).
2. Click on the **Workers** tab.
3. Click on a worker to view its logs and request history.
4. Use the search and filtering capabilities to find specific log entries.
5. Download logs as text files for offline analysis.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing logs

If logs are not appearing in the Logs tab:

1. **Check log throttling**: Excessive logging may trigger throttling.
2. **Verify output streams**: Ensure you're writing to stdout/stderr.
3. **Check worker status**: Logs only appear for successfully initialized workers.
4. **Review retention period**: Logs older than 90 days are automatically removed.

### Log throttling

To avoid log throttling, follow these best practices:

1. **Reduce log verbosity** in production environments.
2. **Use structured logging** to make logs more efficient.
3. **Implement log sampling** for high-frequency events.
4. **Store detailed logs** in network volumes instead of console output.
