SSH into running workers to debug endpoints in production. You can inspect logs, file systems, and environment variables in real-time.

## Requirements

Before you can SSH into a worker, you'll need:

- An SSH key pair added to your Runpod account. See [Connect to a Pod with SSH](/pods/configuration/use-ssh) for instructions.
- At least one running worker. Set active workers to 1 or more in your [endpoint configurations](/serverless/endpoints/endpoint-configurations).

## SSH into a worker

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure you have a running worker">
    Before you can connect, you need at least one worker running. To guarantee a worker is available:

    1. Navigate to the [Serverless section](https://www.console.runpod.io/serverless) of the Runpod console.
    2. Select your endpoint from the list.
    3. Go to the **Configuration** tab.
    4. Under **Worker configuration**, set **Active (min) workers** to 1 or more.
    5. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

    This ensures at least one worker remains running at all times, eliminating cold start delays and allowing you to SSH in.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to your endpoint's Workers tab">
    From the Runpod console:

    1. Go to the [Serverless section](https://www.console.runpod.io/serverless).
    2. Click on your endpoint to open its detail page.
    3. Select the **Workers** tab to view all running workers for this endpoint.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a running worker">
    From the Workers tab, you'll see a list of all workers associated with your endpoint. Find a worker with a status of **Running** and click on it to view its details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the SSH command">
    In the worker details view:

    1. Select the **Connect** tab.
    2. Under the **SSH** section, copy the provided SSH command.

    The command will look similar to this:

    ```bash
    ssh root@worker-id-xyz -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

    <Note>
    If you saved your SSH key to a custom location, update the path after the `-i` flag to match your key's location.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the SSH command">
    Open your local terminal and paste the SSH command you copied. Press Enter to connect to the worker.

    Once connected, you can:
    - Inspect logs and debug output.
    - Check environment variables with `env`.
    - Verify file systems and mounted volumes.
    - Test your worker's behavior in the production environment.
    - Run diagnostic commands to troubleshoot issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues connecting via SSH:

- **No running workers**: Verify that you have at least one active worker by checking the Workers tab. If no workers are running, increase your active workers setting.
- **SSH key authentication fails**: Make sure your SSH public key is properly added to your [Runpod account settings](https://www.console.runpod.io/user/settings). Each key should be on its own line.
- **Connection timeout**: Check your network connection and ensure you're using the correct SSH command from the Connect tab.
- **Permission denied**: Verify that the path to your private key (`-i` flag) is correct and that the key file has appropriate permissions (typically `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).

For more detailed SSH troubleshooting, refer to the [Connect to a Pod with SSH](/pods/configuration/use-ssh#troubleshooting-ssh-key-authentication) guide.
