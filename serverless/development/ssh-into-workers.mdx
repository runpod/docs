SSH into running workers to debug endpoints in development and production. By connecting to a worker, you can inspect logs, file systems, and environment variables in real-time.

## Generate an SSH key and add it to your Runpod account

Before you can SSH into a worker, you'll need to generate an SSH key and add it to your Runpod account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate an SSH key">
    Run this command on your local terminal to generate an SSH key, replacing `YOUR_EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM` with your actual email:

  ```sh
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "YOUR_EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM"
  ```

  This saves a public/private key pair on your local machine to `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` respectively.

  <Warning>
    If you are using Command Prompt on Windows instead of the Linux terminal or WSL, your public and private key pair will be saved to `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_ACCOUNT\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub` and `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_ACCOUNT\.ssh\id_ed25519`, respectively.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retrieve your public SSH key">
    Run this command on your local terminal to retrieve the public SSH key you just generated:

    ```sh
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```
    
    This will output something similar to this:

    ```sh
    ssh-ed25519 AAAAC4NzaC1lZDI1JTE5AAAAIGP+L8hnjIcBqUb8NRrDiC32FuJBvRA0m8jLShzgq6BQ YOUR_EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the key to your Runpod account">
    Copy and paste your public key from the previous step into the **SSH Public Keys** field in your [Runpod user account settings](https://www.console.runpod.io/user/settings).

  <Warning>
  If you need to add multiple SSH keys to your Runpod account, make sure that each key pair is on its own line in the **SSH Public Keys** field.
  </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SSH into a worker

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure you have a running worker">
    Before you can connect, you need at least one worker running. To guarantee a worker is available:

    1. Navigate to the [Serverless section](https://www.console.runpod.io/serverless) of the Runpod console.
    2. Select your endpoint from the list.
    3. Go to the **Configuration** tab.
    4. Under **Worker configuration**, set **Active (min) workers** to 1 or more.
    5. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

    This ensures at least one worker remains running at all times, eliminating cold start delays and allowing you to SSH in.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to your endpoint's Workers tab">
    From the Runpod console:

    1. Go to the [Serverless section](https://www.console.runpod.io/serverless).
    2. Click on your endpoint to open its detail page.
    3. Select the **Workers** tab to view all running workers for this endpoint.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a running worker">
    From the Workers tab, you'll see a list of all workers associated with your endpoint. Find a worker with a status of **Running** and click on it to view its details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the SSH command">
    In the worker details view:

    1. Select the **Connect** tab.
    2. Under the **SSH** section, copy the provided SSH command.

    The command will look similar to this:

    ```bash
    ssh root@worker-id-xyz -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

    <Note>
    If you saved your SSH key to a custom location, update the path after the `-i` flag to match your key's location.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the SSH command">
    Open your local terminal and paste the SSH command you copied. Press Enter to connect to the worker.

    Once connected, you can:
    - Inspect logs and debug output.
    - Check environment variables with `env`.
    - Verify file systems and mounted volumes.
    - Test your worker's behavior in the production environment.
    - Run diagnostic commands to troubleshoot issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting SSH key authentication

If you're asked for a password when connecting to your worker via SSH, this means something is not set up correctly. Runpod does not require a password for SSH connections, as authentication is handled entirely through your SSH key pair.

Here are some common reasons why this might happen:

- If you copy and paste the key *fingerprint* (which starts with `SHA256:`) into your Runpod user settings instead of the actual public key (the contents of your `id_ed25519.pub` file), authentication will fail.
- If you omit the encryption type at the beginning of your public key when pasting it into your Runpod user settings (for example, leaving out `ssh-ed25519`), the key will not be recognized.
- If you add multiple public keys to your Runpod user settings but do not separate them with a newline, only the first key will work. Each key must be on its own line.
- If you specify the wrong file path to your private key when connecting, SSH will not be able to find the correct key (`No such file or directory` error).
- If your private key file is accessible by other users on your machine, SSH may refuse to use it for security reasons (`bad permissions` error).
- If your SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) points to the wrong private key, you will also be prompted for a password. Make sure the `IdentityFile` entry in your config file matches the private key that corresponds to the public key you added to your Runpod account.
