### Convert personal account to a team account

You can convert a personal account to a team account at anytime.

1. From the console, select **Convert to Team Account**.
2. Set a team name and confirm the conversion.

## Get invited by a team member

1. Accept the link sent by a team member.
2. Select **Join Team**.

For information on how to send an invitation, see [Invite a user](#invite-a-user).
