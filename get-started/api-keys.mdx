Learn how to create, edit, and disable RunPod API keys.

<Note>

Legacy API keys generated before November 11, 2024 have either Read/Write or Read Only access to GraphQL based on what was set for that key. All legacy keys have full access to AI API. To improve security, generate a new key with **Restricted** permission and select the minimum permission needed for your use case.

</Note>

## Create an API key

Follow these steps to create a new RunPod API key:

1. In the RunPod console, navigate to the [Settings page](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/settings).

2. Expand the **API Keys** section and select **Create API Key**.

3. Give your key a name and set its permissions (**All**, **Restricted**, or **Read Only**). If you choose **Restricted**, you can customize access for each RunPod API:

   * **None**: No access
   * **Restricted**: Customize access for each of your [Serverless endpoints](/serverless/overview). (Default: None.)
   * **Read/Write**: Full access to your endpoints.
   * **Read Only**: Read access without write access.

4. Select **Create**, then select your newly-generated key to copy it to your clipboard.

<Warning>

RunPod does not store your API key, so you may wish to save it elsewhere (e.g., in your password manager, or in a GitHub secret). Treat your API key like a password and don't share it with anyone.

</Warning>
