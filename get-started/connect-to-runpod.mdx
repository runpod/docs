Runpod offers multiple ways to connect and manage your compute resources. Choose the method that best fits your workflow:

## Runpod console

The Runpod console provides an intuitive web interface to launch and manage Pods, monitor resource usage, access Pod terminals, and view billing and usage history.

## REST API

The Runpod REST API allows you to programmatically manage and control compute resources. Use the API to manage Pod lifecycles and Serverless endpoints, monitor resource utilization, and integrate Runpod into your applications.

## Command-line interface (CLI)

The Runpod CLI allows you to manage Pods from your terminal, execute code on Pods, transfer data between Runpod and local systems, and programmatically manage Serverless endpoints.

Every Pod comes pre-installed with the `runpodctl` command and includes a Pod-scoped API key for seamless command-line management.
