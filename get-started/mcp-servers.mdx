Runpod provides two Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that connect AI tools and agents directly to Runpod. Use the API MCP server to manage your infrastructure, or the docs MCP server to get help with Runpod features.

## Requirements

- A [Runpod API key](/get-started/api-keys) (for the API server only).

## Runpod API MCP server

The Runpod API MCP server gives MCP-compatible tools access to the Runpod REST API, letting you create and manage Pods, Serverless endpoints, and other resources through natural language.

You can find the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/runpod/runpod-mcp).

### Connect with Claude Code

Run this command to install the Runpod API MCP server for Claude Code:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @runpod/runpod-mcp-ts --client claude-code
```

When prompted, enter your Runpod API key.

### Connect with Claude Desktop

Run this command to install the Runpod API MCP server for Claude Desktop:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @runpod/runpod-mcp-ts --client claude
```

When prompted, enter your Runpod API key.

### Usage examples

Once connected, you can ask your tool/agent to interact with your Runpod resources:

**List all Pods**

```
List all my Runpod Pods
```

**Create a new Pod**

```
Create a new Runpod Pod with the following specifications:
- Name: test-pod
- Image: runpod/pytorch:2.1.0-py3.10-cuda11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04
- GPU Type: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090
- GPU Count: 1
```

**Create a Serverless endpoint**

```
Create a Runpod Serverless endpoint with the following configuration:
- Name: my-endpoint
- Template ID: 30zmvf89kd
- Minimum workers: 0
- Maximum workers: 3
```

## Runpod docs MCP server

The Runpod docs MCP server gives MCP-compatible tools access to Runpod documentation, making it easier to get answers about features and how to use them.

The documentation MCP server is available at:

```
https://docs.runpod.io/mcp
````

### Connect with Claude Code

Run this command to add the Runpod docs MCP server to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http runpod-docs --scope user https://docs.runpod.io/mcp
```

### Connect with Claude Desktop

To connect Claude Desktop to the Runpod docs MCP server:

1. Open [Claude](https://claude.ai/) in your browser and go to **Settings** by clicking your profile icon.
2. Select **Connectors** in the sidebar.
3. Scroll down and select **Add custom connector**.
4. Enter `https://docs.runpod.io/mcp` as the URL and select **Add**.
5. Complete any authentication prompts if required.

### Usage examples

Once connected, you can ask your tool/agent questions about Runpod features and documentation:

```
Explain the Runpod Serverless model caching feature
```

```
How does global networking work?
```
