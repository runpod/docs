RunPod projects enable you to develop and deploy endpoints entirely on RunPod's infrastructure. That means you can get a worker up and running without knowing Docker or needing to structure handler code. This Dockerless workflow also streamlines the development process: you don't need to rebuild and push container images or edit your endpoint to use the new image each time you change your code.

To get started, see [Managing Projects](/docs/projects/manage-projects).
