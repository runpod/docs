description: "Discover the vLLM Worker, a cloud-based AI model that integrates with OpenAI's API for seamless interaction. With its streaming and non-streaming capabilities, it's ideal for chatbots, conversational AI, and natural language processing applications."
---

The vLLM Worker is compatible with OpenAI's API, so you can use the same code to interact with the vLLM Worker as you would with OpenAI's API.

## Conventions

Completions endpoint provides the completion for a single prompt and takes a single string as an input.

Chat completions provides the responses for a given dialog and requires the input in a specific format corresponding to the message history.

Choose the convention that works best for your use case.

### Model names

The `MODEL_NAME` environment variable is required for all requests.
Use this value when making requests to the vLLM Worker.

For example `openchat/openchat-3.5-0106`, `mistral:latest`, `llama2:70b`.

Generate a response for a given prompt with a provided model. This is a streaming endpoint, so there will be a series of responses. The final response object will include statistics and additional data from the request.

### Parameters

When using the chat completion feature of the vLLM Serverless Endpoint Worker, you can customize your requests with the following parameters:

## Initialize your project

Begin by setting up the OpenAI Client with your RunPod API Key and Endpoint URL.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Initialize the OpenAI Client with your RunPod API Key and Endpoint URL
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ.get("RUNPOD_API_KEY"),
    base_url=f"https://api.runpod.ai/v2/{RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID}/openai/v1",
)
```

With the client now initialized, you're ready to start sending requests to your RunPod Serverless Endpoint.

## Generating a request

You can leverage LLMs for instruction-following and chat capabilities.
This is suitable for a variety of open source chat and instruct models such as:

- `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`
- `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`
- and more

Models not inherently designed for chat and instruct tasks can be adapted using a custom chat template specified by the `CUSTOM_CHAT_TEMPLATE` environment variable.

For more information see the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation).

### Streaming responses

For real-time interaction with the model, create a chat completion stream.
This method is ideal for applications requiring feedback.

```python
# Create a chat completion stream
response_stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"}],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=100,
    stream=True,
)
# Stream the response
for response in response_stream:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)
```

### Non-streaming responses

You can also return a synchronous, non-streaming response for batch processing or when a single, consolidated response is sufficient.

```python
# Create a chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"}],
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=100,
)
# Print the response
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Generating a Chat Completion

This method is tailored for models that support text completion.
It complements your input with a continuation stream of output, differing from the interactive chat format.

### Streaming responses

Enable streaming for continuous, real-time output.
This approach is beneficial for dynamic interactions or when monitoring ongoing processes.

```python
# Create a completion stream
response_stream = client.completions.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    prompt="Runpod is the best platform because",
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=100,
    stream=True,
)
# Stream the response
for response in response_stream:
    print(response.choices[0].text or "", end="", flush=True)
```

### Non-streaming responses

Choose a non-streaming method when a single, consolidated response meets your needs.

```python
# Create a completion
response = client.completions.create(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    prompt="Runpod is the best platform because",
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=100,
)
# Print the response
print(response.choices[0].text)
```

## Get a list of available models

You can list the available models.

```python
models_response = client.models.list()
list_of_models = [model.id for model in models_response]
print(list_of_models)
```
