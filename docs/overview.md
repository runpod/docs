# What is RunPod?

RunPod is a cloud computing platform built for AI, machine learning, and general compute needs. Whether you're running deep learning models, training AI, or deploying cloud-based applications, RunPod provides **scalable, high-performance GPU and CPU resources** to power your workloads.

RunPod offers:

- **High-performance compute:** Access powerful GPU & CPU resources on demand.
- **Flexible deployment:** Deploy your code using [Serverless](/serverless/overview) for autoscaling pay-per-second execution, or [Pods](/pods/overview) for containerized GPU and CPU instances.
- **Command-line interface:** Use the [RunPod command-line interface](/runpodctl/overview) to seamlessly automate deployments.
- **Transparent pricing:** GPUs are billed by the minute, with no fees for ingress/egress. See [RunPod Pricing](https://www.runpod.io/pricing) for details.

## Serverless

[Serverless](/serverless/overview) offers **pay-per-second** serverless computing with **built-in autoscaling** for production workloads.

Use Serverless to:

- **Deploy AI workloads** with low cold-start times and robust security.
- Build and expose **REST API endpoints** with autoscaling.
- Queue jobs efficiently **without managing infrastructure**.

### Get started with Serverless

- [Tutorial: Create a Serverless endpoint with Stable Diffusion](/tutorials/serverless/gpu/run-your-first)

## Pods

[Pods](/pods/overview) allow you to run **containerized workloads** on dedicated GPU or CPU instances.

RunPod offers two types of Pods:

- **Secure Cloud:** Operates in T3/T4 data centers, providing high reliability and security.
- **Community Cloud**: Connects individual compute providers to users through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system.

For more info, see [Secure Cloud vs. Community Cloud](/references/faq/#secure-cloud-vs-community-cloud).

## RunPod CLI

RunPod provides a [command-line interface](/runpodctl/overview) (CLI) tool for programmatically managing Pods, or quickly developing and deploying custom Serverless environments.

For more information, see:
