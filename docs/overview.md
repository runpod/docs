**RunPod** is a cloud computing platform designed for AI, machine learning applications, and general computing needs.

Leverage our platform to execute your code using both GPU and CPU resources through our [Pods](/pods/overview) and [Serverless](/serverless/overview) computing options.

Start today by [signing up for an account](https://www.runpod.io/console/signup).

## What are Pods?

**Pods** allow you to run your code on GPU and CPU instances using containers.

Pods are available in two types: [Secure Cloud and Community Cloud](references/faq/#secure-cloud-vs-community-cloud). Secure Cloud operates in T3/T4 data centers, providing high reliability and security. Community Cloud connects individual compute providers to consumers through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system.

## What is Serverless?

**Serverless** offers pay-per-second serverless computing with autoscaling capabilities for your production environment.

Define a Worker, create a REST API Endpoint for it, queue jobs, and enjoy autoscaling to meet demand.
This service, part of our Secure Cloud offering, ensures low cold-start times and robust security measures.

Get started with:

- [Building your own Worker image](/serverless/workers/overview)
- [Using any LLM with the vLLM worker](/serverless/workers/vllm/overview)

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

RunPod also provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for quickly developing and deploying custom endpoints on the RunPod serverless platform.
