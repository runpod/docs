RunPod offers multiple ways to connect and manage your compute resources. Choose the method that best fits your workflow:

## Web interface

The [RunPod web interface](https://runpod.io/console/home) provides an intuitive way to:
- Launch and manage Pods.
- Monitor resource usage.
- Access Pod terminals.
- View billing and usage history.

To get started, [create an account](/get-started) and log in at [runpod.io/console](https://www.runpod.io/console).

## REST API

The [RunPod REST API](https://rest.runpod.io/v1/docs) allows you to programmatically manage and control compute resources. Use the API to:

- Manage Pod lifecycles.
- Manage Serverless endpoints.
- Monitor resource utilization.
- Integrate RunPod into your applications.
