## Introduction

This document outlines the specifications required to be a RunPod secure cloud partner. These requirements establish the baseline, however for new partners, RunPod will perform a due diligence process prior to selection encompassing business health, prior performance, and corporate alignment.

Meeting these technical and operational requirements does not guarantee selection.

*New partners*

* All specifications will apply to new partners on November 1, 2024.

*Existing partners*

* Hardware specifications (Sections 1, 2, 3, 4) will apply to new servers deployed by existing partners on December 15, 2024.
* Compliance specification (Section 5) will apply to existing partners on April 1, 2025.

A new revision will be released in October 2025 on an annual basis. Minor mid-year revisions may be made as needed to account for changes in market, roadmap, or customer needs.

Servers should have spare disk slots for future expansion without deployment of new servers.

Even distribution among machines (e.g., 7 TB x 8 disks x 4 servers = 224 TB total space).

### Dedicated Metadata Server for Large-Scale Clusters

Once a storage cluster exceeds 90% single core CPU on the leader node during peak hours, a dedicated metadata server is required. Metadata tracking is a single process operation, and single threaded performance is the most important metric.

| Physical security | RunPod servers must be held in an isolated secure rack or cage in an area that is not accessible to any non-partner or approved DC personnel. Physical access to this area must be tracked and logged. |
| Maintenance       | All maintenance resulting in disruption or downtime must be scheduled at least 1 week in advance. Large disruptions must be coordinated with RunPod at least 1 month in advance.                       |

RunPod will review evidence of:

* Physical access logs
* Redundancy checks
* Refueling agreements
* Power system test results and maintenance logs
* Power monitoring and capacity planning reports
* Network infrastructure diagrams and configurations
* Network performance and capacity reports
* Security audit results and incident response plans

For detailed information on maintenance scheduling, power system management, and network operations, please refer to our documentation.
