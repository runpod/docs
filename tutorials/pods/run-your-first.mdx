This tutorial shows how to deploy a Pod and use JupyterLab to generate text with the SmolLM3 model using the Python `transformers` library.

[SmolLM3](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/smollm3) is a family of small language models developed by Hugging Face that provides strong performance while being efficient enough to run on modest hardware. 
The 3B parameter model we'll use in this tutorial requires only 24 GB of VRAM, making it accessible for experimentation and development.

## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Deploy a Pod with the PyTorch template.
- Access the web terminal and JupyterLab services.
- Install the transformers and accelerate libraries.
- Use SmolLM3 for text generation in a Python notebook.
- Configure model parameters for different use cases.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A [Runpod account](/get-started/manage-accounts).
- At least $5 in Runpod credits.
- Basic familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Step 1: Deploy a Pod with PyTorch template

First, you'll deploy a Pod using the official Runpod PyTorch template:

1. Navigate to the [Pods page](https://console.runpod.io/pods) in the Runpod console.
2. Click **Deploy** to create a new Pod.
3. In the template selection, choose latest the **Runpod PyTorch** template (this should be the default setting).
4. For GPU selection, choose any GPU with 24 GB or more VRAM. Good options include:
   - RTX 4090 (24 GB VRAM)
   - RTX A5000 (24 GB VRAM) 
   - L40 (48 GB VRAM)
5. Keep all the other settings on their defaults.
6. Click **Deploy On-Demand** to create your Pod.

Wait for your Pod to initialize. This typically takes 2-5 minutes.

## Step 2: Install required packages

Once your Pod is running, you'll need to install the `transformers` and `accelerate` Python libraries:

1. In the Runpod console, find and expand your deployed Pod and click **Connect**.
2. Under **Web Terminal**, click **Start** to start the terminal service.
2. Click **Open Web Terminal** to open a terminal session in your browser.
3. In the terminal, install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install transformers accelerate
```

## Step 3: Open JupyterLab

Next we'll prepare our JupyterLab coding environment:

1. Go back to the Runpod console and click **Connect** on your Pod again.
2. Under **HTTP Services**, click **Connect to HTTP Service [Port 8888]** to open JupyterLab.
3. If the JupyterLab service shows as "Not Ready", wait a moment and refresh the page.

JupyterLab will open in a new browser tab, providing you with an interactive Python environment.

## Step 4: Create and run your SmolLM3 notebook

In JupyterLab, create a new notebook to perform inference using the SmolLM3 model:

1. In JupyterLab, click **File** > **New** > **Notebook**.
2. Select **Python 3 (ipykernel)** when prompted for the kernel.
3. In the first cell of your notebook, enter the following code:

```python
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

# Create a text generation pipeline with SmolLM3
pipe = pipeline(
    task="text-generation",
    model="HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map=0
)

# Define a conversation with system and user messages
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm a developer interested in LLMs. Can you suggest some research topics to get started?"},
]

# Generate text with the model
outputs = pipe(messages, max_new_tokens=500, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7, top_k=50, top_p=0.95)

# Print the generated response
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1]['content'])
```

4. Run the cell by pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows) or clicking the **Run** button.

The first time you run this code, it will download the SmolLM3 model (approximately 6 GB), which may take a minute or two depending on your Pod's internet connection. Subsequent runs will be much faster, as the model will be cached locally.

Most likely the response will be truncated—you can increase `max_new_tokens` and run the cell again to get a longer response (it will just take longer to run).

## Step 5: Understanding the code

Let's break down the key components of the code we just ran:

- `pipeline()`: Creates a high-level interface for text generation.
- `model="HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B"`: Specifies the model to use.
- `torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16`: Uses 16-bit floating point for memory efficiency.
- `device_map=0`: Automatically places the model on the first available GPU.
- `messages`: Defines a chat-like conversation with system and user roles.

For more detailed information about SmolLM3's capabilities and parameters, see the [official SmolLM3 documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/smollm3?usage=Pipeline#transformers.SmolLM3Model).


## Step 6: Experiment with different prompts and parameters

Once your model is loaded, you can experiment with different prompts and generation parameters:

### Try different conversation topics

Try running the following code in a new cell:

```python
# Example: Ask for creative writing
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a creative writing assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write the opening paragraph for a mystery story that begins in a library after closing time."},
]

outputs = pipe(messages, max_new_tokens=300, do_sample=True, temperature=0.8)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1]['content'])
```

### Adjust generation parameters

You can modify various parameters to control the model's output:

- `max_new_tokens`: Controls the maximum length of the generated text
- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.1 = more focused, 1.0 = more creative)
- `top_k`: Limits the vocabulary to the top K most likely tokens
- `top_p`: Uses nucleus sampling to control diversity

Try running this in a new cell to see how the output changes:

```python
# More focused and deterministic output
outputs = pipe(messages, max_new_tokens=150, do_sample=True, temperature=0.3, top_p=0.9)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1]['content'])
```

### Use single-turn prompts

You can also use SmolLM3 for simple text completion without the chat format:

```python
# Simple text completion
prompt = "The process of photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth because it allows plants to convert"
outputs = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True, temperature=0.3)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"])
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues:

- **Out of memory errors**: Ensure you're using a GPU with at least 24 GB VRAM, or try reducing the batch size.
- **Model download fails**: Check your internet connection and try running the cell again.
- **JupyterLab not accessible**: Wait a few minutes after Pod deployment for services to fully start. If the JupyterLab tab is blank when you open it, try stopping and then restarting the Pod.
- **Import errors**: Make sure you installed the packages in step 2 using the web terminal.

## Next steps

Now that you have SmolLM3 running, you can explore more advanced use cases:

- **Integration with applications**: Use SmolLM3 as part of larger applications by integrating it with web frameworks or APIs.
- **Model comparison**: Try other models in the SmolLM3 family or compare with other small language models to find the best fit for your use case.
- **Persistent storage**: If you plan to work with SmolLM3 regularly, consider using a [network volume](/storage/network-volumes) to persist your models and notebooks across Pod sessions.
