This tutorial will show you how to configure ComfyUI for Runpod [Pods](/pods/overview) and generate images using the Flux Dev text-to-image model.

[ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/) is a node-based graphical interface for creating AI image generation workflows. Instead of writing code, you connect different components visually to build custom image generation pipelines. This approach provides flexibility to experiment with various models and techniques while maintaining an intuitive interface.

[Flux](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) is a state-of-the-art text-to-image AI model developed by Black Forest Labs. It generates high-quality images from text descriptions and comes in three versions:

- **Flux Schnell**: An open-source model optimized for speed and cost.
- **Flux Dev**: An open-source model optimized for visual fidelity and prompt adherence.
- **Flux Pro**: A premium version available through API access.

The template used in this tutorial uses the Flux Dev model, but you can learn how to install other models (including non-Flux models) in the [Workflow customization](#install-missing-models) section.

## What you'll learn

In this tutorial you'll learn how to:

- Deploy a Pod with ComfyUI pre-installed.
- Connect to the ComfyUI web interface.
- Import and use Flux Dev workflows.
- Generate your first AI image.
- Customize your workflow.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A [Runpod account](/get-started/manage-accounts).
- At least $10 in credits.
- Basic understanding of AI image generation.

## Step 1: Deploy a ComfyUI Pod

First we'll deploy a Pod using a template that pre-installs ComfyUI and Flux Dev:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the template">
    Navigate to the [Flux.1-Dev-ComfyUI template](https://www.runpod.io/console/explore/y1vexvzg7r) in the Runpod console.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Pod">
    Click **Deploy** and configure these settings:
    
    - **GPU selection:** Choose an L40 or RTX 4090 for optimal performance with Flux models. Lower VRAM GPUs may work for smaller projects.
    - **Storage:** The default container and disk volume sizes should be sufficient for Flux Dev. You can also add a [network volume](/pods/storage/create-network-volumes) to your Pod for persistent storage.
    - **Deployment type:** Select **On-Demand** for flexibility.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy and wait">
    Click **Deploy On-Demand** to create your Pod.
    
    The Pod will take up to 30 minutes to initialize the container, download the Flux Dev model, and start the ComfyUI service.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Connect to ComfyUI

Once your Pod is running, connect to the ComfyUI interface:

1. Navigate to the [Pods section](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods) in the Runpod console.
2. Find your deployed Pod in the list.
3. Click **Connect** on your Pod.
4. Select **Connect to HTTP Service [Port 7860]**.

This will open the ComfyUI interface in a new browser tab. The URL follows the format: `https://[POD_ID]-7860.proxy.runpod.net`.

<Note>
If you see an error when first connecting, wait 2-3 minutes for the HTTP service to fully start, then refresh the page.
</Note>

## Step 3: Import a Flux workflow

 The Pod template we deployed comes with the Flux Dev model pre-installed, but we still need a workflow to use it. To import a pre-configured Flux workflow, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the workflow file">
    Visit the [flux-runpod repository](https://github.com/camenduru/flux-runpod/tree/main), locate the `Flux.1-Dev-ComfyUI.json` file, and click the download button in the top right corner of the code block.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import into ComfyUI">
    In the ComfyUI interface, click **Workflow** in the top right corner and select **Open**, then select the `Flux.1-Dev-ComfyUI.json` file using your local file broswer to upload it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Generate your first image

Now the workflow is loaded, follow these steps to generate an image:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customize your prompt">
    Locate the text input node labeled "CLIP Text Encode (Prompt)" in the workflow. 
    
    Click on the text field containing the default prompt and replace it with your desired image description.
    
    Example prompts:
    - "A serene mountain landscape at sunset with a crystal clear lake"
    - "A futuristic cityscape with neon lights and flying vehicles"
    - "A detailed portrait of a robot reading a book in a library"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start generation">
    Click **Run** at the bottom of the workflow (or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) to begin the image generation process.
    
    Watch as the workflow progresses through each node:
    - Text encoding.
    - Model loading.
    - Image generation steps.
    - Final output processing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View your result">
    The generated image appears in the output node when complete. 
    
    Right-click the image to save it to your local machine, view it at full resolution, or copy it to your clipboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Congratulations! You've just generated your first image with ComfyUI on Runpod.

## Workflow customization

Once you're comfortable with basic image generation, explore the [ComfyUI documentation](https://docs.comfy.org/) to learn how to build more advanced workflows.

Here are ideas for where to start:

### Browse workflow templates

In the top-right corner of the ComfyUI interface, click **Workflow** and select **Browse Templates**. This will open a modal with a list of pre-configured workflows.

You can also browse the web for a preconfigured workflow and import it using the procedure from [Step 3](#step-3-import-a-flux-workflow).

### Install missing models

When you open a workflow, you may see a pop-up labeled **Missing Models**, indicating that the workflow requires additional models not present in your Pod. Clicking the **Download** button in the pop-up will download the model to your local machine rather than your running Pod. You can then use the [Runpod CLI](/runpodctl/overview) to [transfer the model files](/runpodctl/transfer-files) to your Pod.

You can also download the model directly to your Pod using the ComfyUI Manager plugin (which comes pre-installed in the ComfyUI Pod template we used). To install a model using the plugin, click **Manager** in the top right of the ComfyUI interface, select **Model Manager**, search for the model(s) you need, then click **Install**.

### Create custom workflows

Build your own workflows by:

1. Right-clicking the canvas to add new nodes.
2. Connecting node outputs to inputs by dragging between connection points.
3. Saving your custom workflow clicking **Workflow** and selecting **Save**.

## Manage your Pod

While working with ComfyUI, monitor your usage by checking GPU utilization and generation times in the [Pods page](https://console.runpod.io/pods) of the Runpod console.

Stop your Pod when you're finished to avoid unnecessary charges.

It's also a good practice to download any custom workflows to your local machine before stopping the Pod. For persistent storage of models and outputs across sessions, consider using a [network volume](/pods/storage/create-network-volumes).

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions:

- **Connection errors**: Wait for the Pod to fully initialize (up to 30 minutes for initial deployment).
- **HTTP service not ready**: Wait at least 2-3 minutes after Pod deployment for the HTTP service to fully start.
- **Out of memory errors**: Reduce image resolution or batch size in your workflow.
- **Slow generation**: Ensure you're using an appropriate GPU for your selected model.

## Next steps

Now that you've mastered the basics of running ComfyUI on Runpod:

- Explore [other AI templates](/pods/templates/overview) available on Runpod.
- Learn about [persistent storage options](/pods/storage/types) for saving your work.
- Connect to your Pod [via SSH](/pods/configuration/use-ssh) for advanced customization.
- Join the [Runpod Discord](https://discord.gg/runpod) to share your creations and get support.
