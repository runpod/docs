Runpod's serverless library enables you to create and deploy scalable functions without managing infrastructure. This tutorial will walk you through creating a simple serverless function that determines whether a number is even.

## Creating a Basic Serverless Function

Let's start by building a function that checks if a given number is even.

### Import the Runpod library

Create a new python file called `is_even.py`.

Import the Runpod library:

```python is_even.py
import runpod
```

### Define your function

Create a function that takes a `job` argument:

```python is_even.py
def is_even(job):
    job_input = job["input"]
    the_number = job_input["number"]

    if not isinstance(the_number, int):
        return {"error": "Please provide an integer."}

    return the_number % 2 == 0
```

This function:

1. Extracts the input from the `job` dictionary
2. Checks if the input is an integer
3. Returns an error message if it's not an integer
4. Determines if the number is even and returns the result

### Start the Serverless function

Wrap your function with `runpod.serverless.start()`:

```python is_even.py
runpod.serverless.start({"handler": is_even})
```

This line initializes the serverless function with your specified handler.

## Complete code example

Here's the full code for our serverless function:

```python is_even.py
import runpod


def is_even(job):
    job_input = job["input"]
    the_number = job_input["number"]

    if not isinstance(the_number, int):
        return {"error": "Please provide an integer."}

    return the_number % 2 == 0


runpod.serverless.start({"handler": is_even})
```

## Testing your Serverless Function

To test your function locally, use the following command:

```bash
python is_even.py --test_input '{"input": {"number": 2}}'
```

When you run the test, you'll see output similar to this:

```bash
--- Starting Serverless Worker |  Version 1.6.2 ---
INFO   | test_input set, using test_input as job input.
DEBUG  | Retrieved local job: {'id': 'some-id', 'input': {'number': 2}}
INFO   | some-id | Started.
DEBUG  | some-id | Handler output: True
DEBUG  | some-id | run_job return: {'output': True}
INFO   | Job some-id completed successfully.
INFO   | Job result: {'output': True}
INFO   | Local testing complete, exiting.
```

This output indicates that:

1. The serverless worker started successfully
2. It received the test input
3. The function processed the input and returned `True` (as 2 is even)
4. The job completed successfully

## Conclusion

You've now created a basic serverless function using Runpod's Python SDK. This approach allows for efficient, scalable deployment of functions without the need to manage infrastructure.

To further explore Runpod's serverless capabilities, consider:

* Creating more complex functions
* Implementing error handling and input validation
* Exploring Runpod's documentation for advanced features and best practices

Runpod's serverless library provides a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, from simple utilities to complex data processing tasks.
