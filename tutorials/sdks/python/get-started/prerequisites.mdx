Setting up a proper development environment is fundamental to effectively building serverless AI applications using RunPod. This guide will take you through each necessary step to prepare your system for RunPod development, ensuring you have the correct tools and configurations.

In this guide, you will learn how to the RunPod library.

When you're finished, you'll have a fully prepared environment to begin developing your serverless AI applications with RunPod.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

* **Python 3.8 or later**: This is the programming language in which you'll be writing your RunPod applications.
* **Access to a terminal or command prompt**: This will be used to run various commands throughout this tutorial.

## Install Python

First, you need to have Python installed on your system. Python is a programming language that's widely used in various types of software development and what is used to develop with the RunPod Python SDK.

To install Python, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest stable version of Python (version is 3.8 or later).
3. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once Python is installed, you can move onto setting up a virtual environment.

## Set up a virtual environment

Using a virtual environment is a best practice in Python development.

It keeps project dependencies isolated, avoiding conflicts between packages used in different projects.

Here’s how you can set up a virtual environment:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command. For example:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment named `venv` by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

This command uses Python's built-in `venv` module to create a virtual environment.

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   * On Windows, use:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   * On macOS and Linux, use:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

Activating the virtual environment ensures that any Python packages you install will be confined to this environment.

You have now set up and activated a virtual environment for your project. The next step is to install the RunPod library within this virtual environment.

## Install the RunPod Library

With the virtual environment activated, you need to install the RunPod Python SDK. This library provides the tools necessary to develop serverless applications on the RunPod platform.

To install the RunPod library, execute:

```bash
pip install runpod
```

This command uses `pip`, Python's package installer, to download and install the latest version of the RunPod SDK.

## Verify the Installation

It's essential to confirm that the RunPod library has been installed correctly. You can do this by running the following Python command:

```bash
python -c "import runpod; print(runpod.__version__)"
```

If everything is set up correctly, this command will output the version number of the installed RunPod SDK.

For example:

```
1.6.2
```

You have now successfully set up your development environment. Your system is equipped with Python, a virtual environment, and the RunPod library.

You will use the RunPod Python library for writing your serverless application.

Next, we'll proceed with creating a [Hello World application with RunPod](/tutorials/sdks/python/get-started/hello-world).
