Welcome to the world of Serverless AI development with the [Runpod Python SDK](https://github.com/runpod/runpod-python).

The Runpod Python SDK helps you develop Serverless AI applications so that you can build and deploy scalable AI solutions efficiently.

This set of tutorials will deepen your understanding of serverless principles and the practical knowledge to use the Runpod Python SDK in your AI applications.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you should have:

* Basic programming knowledge in Python.
* An understanding of AI and machine learning concepts.
* [An account on the Runpod platform](https://www.console.runpod.io/signup).

## What is the Runpod Python SDK?

The [Runpod Python SDK](https://github.com/runpod/runpod-python) is a toolkit designed to facilitate the creation and deployment of serverless applications on the Runpod platform.

It is optimized for AI and machine learning workloads, simplifying the development of scalable, cloud-based AI applications. The SDK allows you to define handler functions, conduct local testing, and utilize GPU support.

Acting as a bridge between your Python code and Runpod's cloud infrastructure, the SDK enables you to execute complex AI tasks without managing underlying hardware.

To start using Runpod Python SDK, see the [prerequisites](/tutorials/sdks/python/get-started/prerequisites) section or if, you're already setup proceed to the [Hello World](/tutorials/sdks/python/get-started/hello-world) tutorial, where we will guide you through creating, deploying, and running your first serverless AI application.

You can also see a library of complete Runpod samples in the [Worker library](https://github.com/runpod-workers) on GitHub. These samples are complete Python libraries for common use cases.
