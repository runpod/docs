## What are these tools?

These are simple bash and Python scripts that solve a critical problem: **migrating data between RunPod instances when you need to move pods** (e.g., when your pod gets stuck with zero GPUs or you need to switch to a different instance).

## The Problem It Solves

When RunPod users encounter issues like:
- Pod stuck with **zero GPUs allocated**
- Need to **migrate to a different GPU type**
- Want to **transfer data between pods**
- Need to **backup data before terminating a pod**

This tool provides a simple solution for transferring your files to a new pod.

## Prerequisites

Before using these tools, ensure:

1. **Terminal access** on your RunPod instances:
   - Web Terminal in RunPod's interface, OR
   - Terminal in Jupyter Notebook/Lab

2. **Port 22 exposed** on destination pod / source pod:
   - Go to: **Pod > Edit Pod > TCP Ports**
   - Add port `22` if not present
   
   <Warning>
   **Important**: Changing TCP ports will restart your pod and **erase all data outside of `/workspace`**. Make sure all important files are stored in `/workspace` (the default persistent directory) before making port changes.
   </Warning>

3. **Linux-based template**: Works on Ubuntu/Debian images (most RunPod templates)

## Quick Migration Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Destination Pod">
    On your **NEW pod** (where files will go):
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinwlin/Runpod-SSH-Password/main/passwordrunpod.sh && chmod +x passwordrunpod.sh && ./passwordrunpod.sh
    ```
    
    The script will prompt you to set a password. After setup, it displays your connection details:
    ```
    You can now connect using: ssh root@213.173.105.86 -p 17958
    Password: [the password you just set]
    ```
    
    **Save these details** - you'll need them in Step 4.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Transfer from Source Pod">
    On your **OLD pod** (where files currently are):
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinwlin/Runpod-SSH-Password/refs/heads/main/SCPMigration -O scp_migration.py && python3 scp_migration.py
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate and Select Files">
    The tool provides an interactive interface:
    
    **Navigation Mode** - Browse directories:
    ```
    Current directory: /workspace
    
    Navigate by entering a number:
     1. models/
     2. data/
     3. ComfyUI/
     
    Navigate to: 1    (enters models folder)
    Navigate to: s    (switch to selection mode)
    ```
    
    **Selection Mode** - Choose what to transfer:
    ```
    Select item: 1    (selects folder/file)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Connection and Transfer">
    Enter the SSH details from Step 1:
    ```
    Enter SSH command: ssh root@213.173.105.86 -p 17958
    Enter password: [the password you set in Step 1]
    ```
    
    The tool will:
    - **Files**: Transfer directly via SCP
    - **Folders**: Compress to ZIP, transfer, then extract automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features

- **Interactive navigation**: Browse files with simple number selection
- **Smart compression**: Automatically zips folders for reliable transfer
- **Mode switching**: Press `s` for selection, `n` for navigation
- **Clean transfer**: Auto-extracts and cleans up on destination
