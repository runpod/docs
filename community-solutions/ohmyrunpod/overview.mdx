## What is OhMyRunPod?

OhMyRunPod is a Python package that solves one of the most common Runpod user problems: **easily transferring files to and from your Pod**.

While OhMyRunPod includes various features, **the SFTP setup functionality** is the one we want to highlight to help easily get setup with file transfer software such as filezilla or similar tools.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with OhMyRunPod, ensure you have:

- An active Runpod account with a running Pod
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your local machine
- Port 22 exposed in your Pod's TCP ports configuration (for SFTP transfers)

## Installation

Install OhMyRunPod using pip:

```bash
pip install OhMyRunPod
```

## Quick Start: File Transfer

The most common use case for OhMyRunPod is transferring files between your local machine and Runpod instances.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure Port 22 is Exposed">
    Before starting, make sure port 22 is exposed in your Pod. This is required for SFTP transfers.
    
    To expose port 22:
    1. Go to your Pod in the RunPod console
    2. Click **Edit Pod**
    3. Under the **TCP Ports** section, add port `22`
    4. Save the changes
    
    <Warning>
    **Data Loss Warning**: Changing TCP ports will restart your pod and **erase all data outside of `/workspace`**. Ensure all important files are in `/workspace` (the default persistent directory) before making port changes.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run File Transfer Command">
    Execute the file transfer command:
    ```bash
    OhMyRunPod --file-transfer
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Transfer Method">
    You'll be presented with transfer options:
    
    <Frame>

    </Frame>
    
    - **Croc**: Easy peer-to-peer file transfer (recommended for quick transfers)
    - **SFTP**: Traditional file transfer via SSH/SFTP clients (recommended for persistent connections)
    
    Use arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="SFTP Setup Complete">
    If you choose SFTP, OhMyRunpod will automatically:
    - Install and configure SSH server
    - Set up SSH keys
    - Generate a secure password
    - Create connection scripts for your operating system
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ohmyrunpod-sftp-confirm.png" alt="SFTP setup confirmation showing connection details and instructions" />
    </Frame>
    
    The tool provides:
    - Complete connection information (server address, port, username, password)
    - Platform-specific connection instructions for FileZilla, WinSCP, Command Line, and VS Code
    - Password saved to `/workspace/root_password.txt` for reference
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Can You Do After Setup?

Once SFTP is configured, you can:

- **Upload datasets**: Transfer training data directly to `/workspace/`
- **Download models**: Pull trained checkpoints back to your local machine
- **Sync code**: Use VS Code Remote-SSH for live editing
- **Backup files**: Regular backups of important work
- **Use any SFTP client**: FileZilla, WinSCP, or command line tools


## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Refused on Port 22">
    **Problem:** Cannot connect via SFTP, getting "Connection refused" error
    
    **Solution:** 
    1. Ensure port 22 is exposed in your Pod (Pod > Edit Pod > TCP Ports > Add 22)
    2. Restart your Pod after adding the port
    3. Re-run `OhMyRunPod --file-transfer` to reconfigure SSH
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission Denied When Connecting">
    **Problem:** Getting "Permission denied" when trying to connect via SFTP
    
    **Solution:** 
    1. Check that you're using the correct password from `/workspace/root_password.txt`
    2. Ensure you're using username `root`
    3. Verify the port number matches what's shown in the connection details
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SFTP Client Can't Find Host">
    **Problem:** SFTP client cannot resolve the host address
    
    **Solution:** 
    1. Verify your Pod is running and not stopped
    2. Check that you're using the correct IP address and port from the connection details
    3. Ensure your network allows outbound connections to the RunPod IP range
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips

<Tip>
The password is automatically saved to `/workspace/root_password.txt` for your reference.
</Tip>

<Tip>
For large file transfers, use a dedicated SFTP client like FileZilla or WinSCP instead of command line.
