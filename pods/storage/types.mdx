The following section describes the different types of storage and volume options.

## Container volume

A container volume is a type of storage that houses the operating system and provides temporary storage for a Pod. It is created when a Pod is launched and is tightly coupled with the Pod's lifecycle.

**Key characteristics:**

* Volatile storage that is lost if the Pod is halted or rebooted
* Suitable for storing temporary data or files that are not required to persist beyond the Pod's lifecycle
* Capacity is determined by the selected Pod configuration
* Provides fast read and write speeds as it is locally attached to the Pod

## Disk volume

A disk volume is a type of persistent storage that is preserved for the duration of the Pod's lease. It functions similarly to a hard disk, allowing you to store data that needs to be retained even if the Pod is halted or rebooted.

**Key characteristics:**

* Persistent storage that remains available throughout the Pod's lease period
* Suitable for storing data, models, or files that need to be preserved across Pod restarts or reconfigurations
* Capacity can be selected based on storage requirements
* Provides reliable data persistence but may have slightly slower read and write speeds compared to container volumes

## Network storage

Network storage is a type of storage that is similar to a disk volume but offers the flexibility to be moved between different machines. It provides a way to store and access data across multiple Pods or instances.

**Key characteristics:**

* Persistent storage that can be attached to different Pods or machines
* Suitable for scenarios where data needs to be shared or accessed by multiple Pods
* Allows for data portability and facilitates collaboration between different instances
* Provides data persistence and the ability to move storage between Pods
* When using network storage, you can only delete the Pod, as the storage is managed separately
