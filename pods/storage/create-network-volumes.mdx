Network volumes offer persistent storage that, unlike standard Pod disk volumes, exists independently from any single Pod's lifecycle. This means your data is retained even if a Pod is deleted. They can be attached to multiple Pods (though not simultaneously to multiple running Pods), making them ideal for sharing data, transferring storage between machines, or maintaining datasets for Serverless workers.

When attached to a Pod, a network volume replaces the Pod's default disk volume and is typically mounted at `~/workspace`.

For a comparison with other storage types, see [Storage options](/pods/storage/types).

## When to use a network volume

Consider using a network volume when you need:

*   **Persistent data that outlives individual Pods:** Keep your data safe and accessible even after a Pod is terminated.
*   **Shareable storage:** Use the same data across different Pods or with Serverless workers. While a network volume can be *attached* to multiple Pod configurations, it can only be *actively used* by one running Pod or Serverless worker at a time to prevent data corruption. You would typically stop a Pod before attaching its network volume to a new Pod.
*   **Portable storage:** Easily move your working environment and data to a different Pod, perhaps in a different GPU pool if your preferred option isn't available.
*   **Efficient data management:** Store frequently used models or large datasets to avoid re-downloading them for each new Pod or Serverless worker, saving time and bandwidth.

## Prerequisites

- You must be using RunPod's Secure Cloud or Serverless offerings.

## How to create a network volume

Follow these steps to create a new network volume:

1.  Navigate to the **Storage** page in the RunPod console.
2.  Click the **+ Network Volume** button.

    </Frame>

3.  **Configure your volume:**
    *   The pricing for the volume will be displayed.
    *   Select a data center for your volume. Choose a location that is geographically close to where your Pods will run for optimal performance.
    *   Provide a descriptive name for your volume (e.g., "project-alpha-data" or "stable-diffusion-models").
    *   Specify the desired size for the volume in gigabytes (GB).

    </Frame>

4.  **Confirm creation:** Click "Create Volume". It will then appear in your list of network volumes on the Storage page.

## How to use a network volume with a Pod

Network volumes are attached when you deploy a new Pod.

1.  **Initiate Pod deployment:** Start the process of deploying a new Pod from the Secure Cloud > Pods page by clicking **+ New Pod**.
2.  **Select network volume:** During the Pod configuration, under the "Volume Type" or similar section, choose "Network Volume". Then, select your desired, pre-existing network volume from the dropdown list.

    <Note>
    Network volumes must be attached during Pod creation. They cannot be attached to an already running Pod, nor can they be unattached later without deleting the Pod.
    </Note>

3.  **Observe storage configuration:** After selecting the network volume, you'll notice that your Pod's container disk size is locked to the size of the chosen network volume, as illustrated below. The standard Pod disk cost is also replaced by the charge for the network volume storage.

    </Frame>

4.  **Complete deployment:** Proceed with the rest of the Pod deployment. Your new Pod will use the attached network volume, mounted at `~/workspace` by default.

## Benefits and infrastructure

Using network volumes provides significant flexibility and can lead to cost savings, especially if you frequently switch between Pods or need to share large datasets. Storing data on a shared network volume can be more economical than provisioning separate disk space for multiple Pods. You can achieve overall cost savings even with just two Pods sharing one volume.

Network volumes are backed by high-performance storage servers co-located with RunPod GPU servers. These are connected via high-speed networks (25Gbps, up to 200Gbps in some locations) and use NVMe SSDs for optimal performance, ensuring efficient data transfer and minimal latency.

<Warning>
  **Important:** If your account lacks sufficient funds to cover storage costs, your machine-based storage or network volume may be terminated. Once terminated, the disk space is immediately freed for other users, and RunPod cannot recover lost data. Ensure your account remains funded to prevent data loss.
</Warning>
