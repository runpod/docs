Savings plans are a cost-effective option for your RunPod workloads, offering discounted rates when you commit to an upfront payment for a specific period. This guide explains how savings plans work and how to activate a savings plan when deploying a new Pod.

## How savings plans work

When you opt for a savings plan during Pod deployment, you make an upfront commitment for a chosen duration, such as 3 months or 6 months. In return, you receive a significantly lower hourly rate for the Pod.

The plan remains active for the entire committed period and expires on a predetermined date, with the discount applying as long as the Pod runs or until the plan expires. The savings plan discount is automatically applied to the running Pod once it's deployed with the plan.

## Pricing options

    -   **On-Demand**: Select this option to deploy your Pod with the standard on-demand pricing. On-demand instances are non-interruptible as long as you have the funds to keep your Pod running. 
    -   **3 Month Savings Plan**: Select this option to deploy your Pod with a 3 month savings plan.
    -   **6 Month Savings Plan**: Select this option to deploy your Pod with a 6 month savings plan.
    -   **Spot**: Select this option to deploy your Pod with a spot instance. Spot instances are interruptible and can be terminated by RunPod at any time.

## Benefits of deploying with a savings plan

Savings plans offer substantial discounts on hourly rates compared to standard on-demand pricing. You can lock in costs for your long-running workloads with a fixed upfront payment and known discounted rates.

When you stop a Pod, the savings plan associated with it applies to your next deployment of the same card. This means you continue to benefit from your savings commitment even after temporary pauses in your Pod usage. However, stopping your Pod does not extend your savings plan, as each plan has a fixed expiration date that you set when you buy it.

## Deploying a Pod with a savings plan

You can select a savings plan directly when configuring and deploying a new Pod from the RunPod console.

1.  Open the [Pods page](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods) in the RunPod console and select **Deploy**.

2.  **Configure your Pod (see [Create a Pod](/pods/manage-pods#create-a-pod)).**

3.  Under **Instance Pricing**, select one of the following options:
    -   **On-Demand**: Select this option to deploy your Pod with the standard on-demand pricing. On-demand instances are non-interruptible as long as you have the funds to keep your Pod running. 
    -   **3 Month Savings Plan**: Select this option to deploy your Pod with a 3 month savings plan.
    -   **6 Month Savings Plan**: Select this option to deploy your Pod with a 6 month savings plan.
    -   **Spot**: Select this option to deploy your Pod with a spot instance. Spot instances are interruptible and can be terminated by RunPod at any time.

4.  **Review and deploy:**
    *   Carefully review your Pod's configuration details and the terms of the selected savings plan (upfront cost, duration, discounted rate).
    *   Click **Deploy On-Demand** to proceed.
    *   The upfront cost for the savings plan will be charged to your RunPod credits, and your Pod will begin deploying with the discounted rate active.

## Tracking your savings plans

After deployment, you can monitor all your active savings plans, including their associated Pods, commitment periods, and expiration dates, by visiting the dedicated **Savings plans** section in your RunPod console.

## Important considerations

When using savings plans, it's important to remember a few key points. They deliver the most value for Pods intended to run continuously or for significant portions of the committed term. The payment for the savings plan is made upfront and is generally non-refundable. Additionally, a savings plan is tied to a specific term and often a specific GPU type. Stopping the Pod does not pause the plan's duration; however, if you stop a Pod with an active savings plan, its benefits can typically be applied to a new Pod deployment of the *same GPU type* until the plan expires. Always ensure you have enough credits to cover the upfront cost before committing to a savings plan.
