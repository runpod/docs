Runpod's Cloud Sync feature makes it easy to export your Pod data to external cloud storage providers. This guide walks you through setting up and using Cloud Sync with supported providers.

Cloud Sync supports exporting data to these cloud storage providers:

- Amazon S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
- Dropbox
- Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage

## Security best practices

When using Cloud Sync, follow these security guidelines to protect your data and credentials:

- Keep all access keys, tokens, and credentials confidential.
- Use dedicated service accounts or application-specific credentials when possible.
- Grant only the minimum permissions required for data transfer.
- Regularly rotate your access credentials.
- Monitor your cloud storage logs for unauthorized access.

## Amazon S3

Amazon S3 provides scalable object storage that integrates seamlessly with Runpod through Cloud Sync.

Follow the steps below to export your data to Amazon S3:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an S3 bucket">
    Navigate to the [Amazon S3 bucket creation form](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/bucket/create?region=us-east-1) in your AWS console.

    Provide a descriptive name for your bucket that reflects its purpose or contents. Select your preferred AWS Region. This affects data storage location and access speeds.

    If you need your bucket to be publicly accessible, uncheck the **Block public access** option at the bottom of the form. For most use cases, keeping this checked provides better security.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate access credentials">
    Go to **Security credentials** in your AWS account settings. Create a new Access Key on the Security credentials page.

    Your Secret Access Key will be displayed only once during creation. Make sure to save it securely, as you cannot retrieve it later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Cloud Sync">
    In the Runpod console, navigate to the [Pods page](https://runpod.io/console/pods) and select the Pod containing your data. Click **Cloud Sync** to open the export interface.

    Select **AWS S3** from the available providers. Enter your **AWS Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** in the provided fields. Specify the **AWS Region** where your bucket is located and provide the complete bucket path.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your data from Runpod">
    Click **Copy to AWS S3** to initiate the transfer. The Cloud Sync interface will display transfer progress in real-time.

    Monitor the transfer status to ensure successful completion. Large datasets may take time depending on your Pod's network connection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alternative transfer methods

While Cloud Sync provides the easiest way to export data to cloud providers, you can also transfer files between your Pod and other destinations using:

- **runpodctl**: A built-in CLI tool for peer-to-peer transfers using one-time codes.
- **SSH-based tools**: Use SCP or rsync for direct transfers to your local machine.
- **Network volumes**: For persistent storage across multiple Pods.

For detailed instructions on these methods, see our [file transfer guide](/pods/storage/transfer-files).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during export:

- **Transfer fails immediately**: Verify your credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions.
- **Slow transfer speeds**: Large datasets take time to transfer. Consider compressing data before export or using incremental transfers.
- **Permission denied errors**: Ensure your bucket or container has the correct access policies. Some providers require specific permission configurations for external access.
- **Connection timeouts**: Check that your Pod has stable network connectivity. You may need to retry the transfer.

For additional support, consult your cloud provider's documentation or contact Runpod support.
