Pods provide instant access to powerful GPU and CPU resources for AI development, machine learning, rendering, and other compute-intensive workloads. 

Pods give you full control over your computing environment, allowing you to customize software, storage, and networking to match your exact requirements. Alternatively, you can use pre-configured templates that include ready-to-use environments for popular AI frameworks and applications. 

Pods are billed by the minute, and RunPod offers long-term [savings plans](/pods/savings-plans) for extended usage patterns.

## Pod architecture and configuration

Each Pod is a comprehensive computing environment with a unique identifier (e.g., `2s56cp0pof1rmt`) and several integrated components.

### Operating system

Pods run on an **Ubuntu Linux environment** that supports virtually any Ubuntu-compatible software, giving you full flexibility for your workloads.

This environment provides access to dedicated resources, including **allocated vCPUs and system RAM** exclusively for your workload.

Optional **GPU/CPU acceleration** is available for specialized CUDA workloads, AI/ML tasks, and other compute-intensive operations.

### GPU configuration

You can select from a range of [NVIDIA GPU types and quantities](/references/gpu-types) to power your workloads. The system disk size can be configured based on your application needs, and you can define custom start commands that run when your container is initialized.

### Storage

The **container volume** houses the operating system and temporary storage that exists only during the Pod's active session.

A **disk volume** provides permanent storage that's preserved throughout the Pod's lease, functioning like a dedicated hard drive.

Optional **network volumes** provide flexible storage that can be transferred between machines (when using network storage, you can safely delete your Pod without losing your data).

For more information, see [Storage types](/pods/storage/types).

### Templates

You can use [Pod templates](/pods/templates/overview) to automate software installation and configuration during Pod creation, providing one-click access to common environments.

### Connectivity

You can expose [HTTP/TCP ports](/pods/configuration/expose-ports) on your Pod to configure networking for web services and applications, using URLs like this:

```
https://[POD_ID]-[INTERNAL_PORT].proxy.runpod.net
```

You can also configure [global networking](/pods/networking) to allow your Pods to communicate with each other as if they were on the same local network, regardless of their physical location.

### Data transfer

You can transfer data from your Pod to [most major cloud providers](/pods/configuration/export-data), and to your local machine using the [RunPod CLI](/runpodctl/overview).

### Environment variables

[Environment variables](/pods/references/environment-variables) allow you to set configuration parameters for your applications. Various [persistent storage options](/pods/storage/types) are available to preserve your data across sessions.

## Pod types

RunPod offers [two types of Pods](/references/faq/#secure-cloud-vs-community-cloud):

- **Secure Cloud:** Operates in T3/T4 data centers, providing high reliability and security for enterprise and production workloads.
- **Community Cloud:** Connects individual compute providers to users through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system, with competitive pricing options.


## Deploy a Pod

To deploy a Pod, follow these steps:

1. [Choose a Pod](/pods/choose-a-pod) based on your computing needs and budget.
2. Navigate to the [Pod creation page](https://console.runpod.io/pod/create).
3. Configure your Pod settings including GPU type, storage, and networking options.
4. Launch your Pod and connect using SSH, JupyterLab, or your preferred remote access method.
5. [Manage your Pod](/pods/manage-pods) through the RunPod console.

## Advanced deployment options

Pods can be deployed using container images from any registry, including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Amazon Elastic Container Registry, or other compatible services.

<Note>

When building a container image for RunPod on a Mac (Apple Silicon), use the flag `--platform linux/amd64` to ensure your image is compatible with the platform.
