Pods are running container instances. You can pull an instance from a container registry such as Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Amazon Elastic Container Registry, or another compatible registry.

<Info>

When building an image for RunPod on a Mac (Apple Silicon), use the flag `--platform linux/amd64` to ensure your image is compatible with the platform. This flag is necessary because RunPod currently only supports the `linux/amd64` architecture.

## Pod types

RunPod offers [two types of Pods](/references/faq/#secure-cloud-vs-community-cloud).

* **Secure Cloud:** Operates in T3/T4 data centers, providing high reliability and security.
* **Community Cloud**: Connects individual compute providers to users through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system.

## Understanding Pod components and configuration

A Pod is a server container created by you to access the hardware, with a dynamically generated assigned identifier. For example, `2s56cp0pof1rmt` identifies the instance.

A Pod comprises a container volume with the operating system and temporary storage, a disk volume for permanent storage, an Ubuntu Linux container, allocated vCPU and system RAM, optional GPUs or CPUs for specific workloads, a pre-configured template for easy software access, and a proxy connection for web access.

Each Pod encompasses a variety of components:

* A container volume that houses the operating system and temporary storage.
  * This storage is volatile and will be lost if the Pod is halted or rebooted.
* A disk volume for permanent storage, preserved for the duration of the Pod's lease, akin to a hard disk.
  * This storage is persistent and will be available even if the Pod is halted or rebooted.
* Network storage, similar to a volume but can be moved between machines.
  * When using network storage, you can only delete the Pod.
* An Ubuntu Linux container, capable of running almost any software that can be executed on Ubuntu.
* Assigned vCPU and system RAM dedicated to the container and any processes it runs.
* Optional GPUs or CPUs, tailored for specific workloads like CUDA or AI/ML tasks, though not mandatory for starting the container.
* A pre-configured template that automates the installation of software and settings upon Pod creation, offering straightforward, one-click access to various packages.
* A proxy connection for web access, allowing connectivity to any open port on the container.
  * For example, `https://[pod-id]-[port number].proxy.runpod.net`, or `https://2s56cp0pof1rmt-7860.proxy.runpod.net/`).
