## Before you begin

If you want to manage Pods using the Runpod CLI, you'll need to [install Runpod CLI](/runpodctl/install-runpodctl), and set your [API key](/get-started/api-keys) in the configuration.

Run the following command, replacing `RUNPOD_API_KEY` with your API key:

```sh
runpodctl config --apiKey RUNPOD_API_KEY
```

## Deploy a Pod

<Tip>
You can deploy preconfigured Pods from the repos listed in the [Runpod Hub](/hub/overview). For more info, see the [Hub deployment guide](/hub/overview#deploy-as-a-pod).
</Tip>


<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
To create a Pod using the Runpod console:

1. Open the [Pods page](https://www.console.runpod.io/pods) in the Runpod console and click the **Deploy** button.
2. (Optional) Specify a [network volume](/storage/network-volumes) if you need to share data between multiple Pods, or to save data for later use.
3. Select **GPU** or **CPU** using the buttons in the top-left corner of the window, and follow the configuration steps below.

GPU configuration:

1. Select a graphics card (e.g., A40, RTX 4090, H100 SXM).
2. Give your Pod a name using the **Pod Name** field.
3. (Optional) Choose a **Pod Template** such as **Runpod Pytorch 2.1** or **Runpod Stable Diffusion**.
4. Specify your **GPU count** if you need multiple GPUs.
5. Click **Deploy On-Demand** to deploy and start your Pod.

<Warning>
**CUDA Version Compatibility**

When using templates (especially community templates like `runpod/pytorch:2.8.0-py3.11-cuda12.8.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu22.04`), ensure the host machine's CUDA driver version matches or exceeds the template's requirements.

If you encounter errors like "OCI runtime create failed" or "unsatisfied condition: cuda>=X.X", you need to filter for compatible machines:

1. Click **Additional filters** in the Pod creation interface
2. Click **CUDA Versions** filter dropdown
3. Select a CUDA version that matches or exceeds your template's requirements (e.g., if the template requires CUDA 12.8, select 12.8 or higher)

</Frame>

**Note:** Check the template name or documentation for CUDA requirements. When in doubt, select the latest CUDA version as newer drivers are backward compatible.
</Warning>

CPU configuration:

1. Select a **CPU type** (e.g., CPU3/CPU5, Compute Optimized, General Purpose, Memory-Optimized).
2. Specify the number of CPUs and quantity of RAM for your Pod by selecting an **Instance Configuration**.
3. Give your Pod a name using the **Pod Name** field.
4. Click **Deploy On-Demand** to deploy and start your Pod.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Command line">
To create a Pod using the CLI, use the `runpodctl create pods` command:

```sh
runpodctl create pods \
  --name hello-world \
  --gpuType "NVIDIA A40" \
  --imageName "runpod/pytorch:3.10-2.0.0-117" \
  --containerDiskSize 10 \
  --volumeSize 100 \
  --args "bash -c 'mkdir /testdir1 && /start.sh'"
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="REST API">
To create a Pod using the REST API, send a POST request to the `/pods` endpoint:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://rest.runpod.io/v1/pods \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer RUNPOD_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

### Custom templates

Runpod supports custom [Pod templates](/pods/templates/overview) that let you define your environment using a Dockerfile.

With custom templates, you can:

* Install specific dependencies and packages.
* Configure your development environment.
* Create [portable Docker images](/tutorials/introduction/containers/overview) that work consistently across deployments.
* Share environments with team members for collaborative work.

## Stop a Pod

<Tip>
If your Pod has a [network volume](/storage/network-volumes) attached, it cannot be stopped, only terminated. When you terminate the Pod, data in the `/workspace` directory will be preserved in the network volume, and you can regain access by deploying a new Pod with the same network volume attached.
</Tip>

When a Pod is stopped, data in the container volume is cleared, but data in the `/workspace` directory is preserved. To learn more about how Pod storage works, see [Storage overview](/pods/storage/types).

By stopping a Pod you are effectively releasing the GPU on the machine, and you may be reallocated 0 GPUs when you start the Pod again. For more info, see the [FAQ](/references/faq#why-do-i-have-zero-gpus-assigned-to-my-pod%3F).

<Warning>
After a Pod is stopped, you will still be charged for its [disk volume](/pods/storage/types#disk-volume) storage. If you don't need to retain your Pod environment, you should terminate it completely.
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
To stop a Pod:

1. Open the [Pods page](https://www.console.runpod.io/pods).
2. Find the Pod you want to stop and expand it.
3. Click the **Stop button** (square icon).
4. Confirm by clicking the **Stop Pod** button.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Command line">
To stop a Pod, enter the following command.

```sh
runpodctl stop pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID
```

Example output:

```sh
pod "gq9xijdra9hwyd" stopped
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>


### Stop a Pod after a period of time

You can also stop a Pod after a specified period of time. The examples below show how to use the CLI or [web terminal](/pods/connect-to-a-pod#web-terminal) to schedule a Pod to stop after 2 hours of runtime.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Command line">
Use the following command to stop a Pod after 2 hours:

```sh
sleep 2h; runpodctl stop pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID &
```

This command uses sleep to wait for 2 hours before executing the `runpodctl stop pod` command to stop the Pod. The `&` at the end runs the command in the background, allowing you to continue using the SSH session.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Web terminal">
To stop a Pod after 2 hours using the web terminal, enter:

```sh
nohup bash -c "sleep 2h; runpodctl stop pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID" &
```

`nohup` ensures the process continues running if you close the web terminal window.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Start a Pod

Pods start as soon as they are created, but you can resume a Pod that has been stopped.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
To start a Pod:

1. Open the [Pods page](https://www.console.runpod.io/pods).
2. Find the Pod you want to start and expand it.
3. Click the **Start** button (play icon).

</Tab>

<Tab title="Command line">
To start a single Pod, enter the command `runpodctl start pod`. You can pass the environment variable `RUNPOD_POD_ID` to identify each Pod.

```sh
runpodctl start pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID
```

Example output:

```sh
pod "wu5ekmn69oh1xr" started with $0.290 / hr
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Terminate a Pod

<Warning>

Terminating a Pod permanently deletes all associated data that isn't stored in a [network volume](/storage/network-volumes). Be sure to export or download any data that you'll need to access again.

</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
To terminate a Pod:

1. Open the [Pods page](https://www.console.runpod.io/pods).
2. Find the Pod you want to terminate and expand it.
3. [Stop the Pod](#stop-a-pod) if it's running.
4. Click the **Terminate** button (trash icon).
5. Confirm by clicking the **Yes** button.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Command line">
To remove a single Pod, enter the following command.

```sh
runpodctl remove pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID
```

Example output:

```sh
pod "wu5ekmn69oh1xr" removed
```

You can also remove Pods in bulk. For example, the following command terminates up to 40 Pods with the name `my-bulk-task`.

```sh
runpodctl remove pods my-bulk-task --podCount 40
```

You can also terminate a Pod by name:

```sh
runpodctl remove pods [POD_NAME]
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## View Pod details

You can find a list of all your Pods on the [Pods page](https://www.console.runpod.io/pods) of the web interface.

If you're using the CLI, use the following command to list your Pods:

```sh
runpodctl get pod
```

Or use this command to get the details of a single Pod:

```sh
runpodctl get pod [POD_ID]
```

## Access logs

Pods provide two types of logs to help you monitor and troubleshoot your workloads:

- **Container logs** capture all output sent to your console standard output, including application logs and print statements.
- **System logs** provide detailed information about your Pod's lifecycle, such as container creation, image download, extraction, startup, and shutdown events.

To view your logs, open the [Pods page](https://www.console.runpod.io/pods), expand your Pod, and click the **Logs** button. This gives you real-time access to both container and system logs, making it easy to diagnose issues or monitor your Pod's activity.

## Troubleshooting

### Pod stuck on initializing

If your Pod is stuck on initializing, check for these common issues:

1. You're trying to SSH into the Pod but didn't provide an idle job like `sleep infinity` to keep it running.
2. The Pod received a command it can't execute. Check your logs for syntax errors or invalid commands.

If you need help, [contact support](https://www.runpod.io/contact).

### Docker daemon limitations

Runpod manages the Docker daemon for you, which means you can't run your own Docker instance inside a Pod. This prevents you from building Docker containers or using tools like Docker Compose.

To work around this, create a [custom template](/pods/templates/overview) with the Docker image you need.
