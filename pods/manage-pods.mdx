## Before you begin

If you want to manage Pods using the RunPod CLI, you'll need to [install RunPod CLI](/runpodctl/install-runpodctl), and set your [API key](/get-started/api-keys) in the configuration.

Run the following command, replacing `[RUNPOD_API_KEY]` with your API key:

```sh
runpodctl config --apiKey [RUNPOD_API_KEY]
```

## Create a Pod

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
To create a Pod using the web interface:

1. Open the [Pods page](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods) in the RunPod console and click the **Deploy** button.
2. (Optional) Specify a **Network Volume** if you need to share data between multiple Pods, or to save data for later use.
3. Select **GPU** or **CPU** using the buttons in the top-left corner of the window, and follow the configuration steps below.

GPU configuration:

1. Select a graphics card (e.g., A40, RTX 4090, H100 SXM).
2. Give your Pod a name using the **Pod Name** field.
3. (Optional) Choose a **Pod Template** such as **RunPod Pytorch 2.1** or **RunPod Stable Diffusion**.
4. Specify your **GPU count** if you need multiple GPUs.
5. Click **Deploy On-Demand** to deploy and start your Pod.

CPU configuration:

1. Select a **CPU type** (e.g., CPU3/CPU5, Compute Optimized, General Purpose, Memory-Optimized).
2. Specify the number of CPUs and quantity of RAM for your Pod by selecting an **Instance Configuration**.
3. Give your Pod a name using the **Pod Name** field.
4. Click **Deploy On-Demand** to deploy and start your Pod.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Command line">
To create a Pod using the CLI, use the `runpodctl create pods` command:

```sh
runpodctl create pods \
  --name hello-world \
  --gpuType "NVIDIA A40" \
  --imageName "runpod/pytorch:3.10-2.0.0-117" \
  --containerDiskSize 10 \
  --volumeSize 100 \
  --args "bash -c 'mkdir /testdir1 && /start.sh'"
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Custom templates

RunPod supports custom [Pod templates](/pods/templates/overview) that let you define your environment using a Dockerfile.

With custom templates, you can:

* Install specific dependencies and packages.
* Configure your development environment.
* Create [portable Docker images](/tutorials/introduction/containers/overview) that work consistently across deployments.
* Share environments with team members for collaborative work.

## Stop a Pod

<Warning>

When a Pod is stopped, data in the container volume is cleared, but data in the `/workspace` directory is preserved. To learn more, see [Storage options](/pods/storage/types).

You will be charged for idle Pods even if they are stopped. If you don't need to retain your Pod environment, you should terminate it completely.

</Warning>


<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
1. Open the [Pods page](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods).
2. Find the Pod you want to stop and expand it.
3. Click the **Stop button** (square icon).
4. Confirm by clicking the **Stop Pod** button.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Command line">
To stop a Pod, enter the following command.

```sh
runpodctl stop pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Stop a Pod after a period of time

You can also stop a Pod after a specified period of time. The examples below show how to use the CLI and the [web terminal](/pods/connect-to-a-pod#web-terminal) to schedule a Pod to stop after 2 hours of runtime.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Command line">
Use the following command to stop a Pod after 2 hours:

```sh
sleep 2h; runpodctl stop pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID &
```

This command uses sleep to wait for 2 hours before executing the `runpodctl stop pod` command to stop the Pod. The `&` at the end runs the command in the background, allowing you to continue using the SSH session.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Web terminal">
To stop a Pod after 2 hours using the web terminal, enter:

```sh
nohup bash -c "sleep 2h; runpodctl stop pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID" &
```

`nohup` ensures the process continues running if you close the web terminal window.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Start a Pod

Pods start as soon as they are created, but you can resume a Pod that has been stopped.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
1. Open the [Pods page](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods).
2. Find the Pod you want to start and expand it.
3. Click the **Start** button (play icon).

</Tab>

<Tab title="Command line">
To start a single Pod, enter the command `runpodctl start pod`. You can pass the environment variable `RUNPOD_POD_ID` to identify each Pod.

```sh
runpodctl start pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Terminate a Pod

<Warning>

Terminating a Pod permanently deletes all data outside of a [network volume](/pods/storage/create-network-volumes). Be sure to export or download any data that you'll need to access again.

</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
1. Open the [Pods page](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods).
2. Find the Pod you want to terminate and expand it.
3. [Stop the Pod](#stop-a-pod) if it's running.
4. Click the **Terminate** button (trash icon).
5. Confirm by clicking the **Yes** button.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Command line">
To remove a single Pod, enter the following command.

```sh
runpodctl remove pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID
```

You can also remove Pods in bulk. For example, the following command terminates up to 40 Pods with the name `my-bulk-task`.

```sh
runpodctl remove pods my-bulk-task --podCount 40
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## List Pods

You can find a list of all your Pods on the [Pods page](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods) of the web interface.

If you're using the CLI, use the following command to list your Pods:

```sh
runpodctl get pod
```
